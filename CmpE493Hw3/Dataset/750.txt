sky watchers in western north america are in for a treat : a nearly five - minute total lunar eclipse this morning
here 's how it 's unfolding : it started at 3:16 a.m. pacific daylight time , when the moon began moving into earth 's shadow
for the next hour and 45 minutes , that shadow will move across the moon and engulf it at 4:58 a.m. pacific time
the total eclipse will only last four minutes and 43 seconds , and nasa says that makes it the shortest one of the century
watch it live on nasa tv while people west of the mississippi river will have the best view , at least a partial eclipse will be visible across the nation
but sunrise will interrupt the show on the east coast
parts of south america , india , china and russia also will be able to see the eclipse , but it wo n't be visible in greenland , iceland , europe , africa or the middle east
a lunar eclipse happens when the sun , earth and moon form a straight line in space , with the earth smack in the middle
the sun shines on the earth and creates a shadow
as the moon moves deeper into that shadow , it appears to turn dark and may even appear to be a reddish color
why red ? because earth 's atmosphere is filtering out most of the blue light
some people have nicknamed the effect the " blood moon
" nasa says lunar eclipses typically happen at least twice a year , but this eclipse is the third in a series of four in a row , known as a " tetrad
" the first was on april 15 , 2014
the second was in september 2014 , the next is saturday and there will be one more , on september 28
if you want to learn more about the eclipse , nasa astronomer mitzi adams will take questions on twitter @ nasa_marshall
