one year after it was perpetrated , the kidnapping of nearly 300 schoolgirls by a jihadist group in nigeria remains a crime almost too horrifying to comprehend : hundreds of teenaged girls , just finishing school , destined perhaps for significant achievement -- kidnapped , never to be seen again
" this crime has rightly caused outrage both in nigeria and across the world , " the country 's president - elect , muhammadu buhari , said tuesday in marking the anniversary
" today is a time to reflect on the pain and suffering of the victims , their friends and families
our thoughts and prayers , and that of the whole nigerian nation , are with you today
" the girls were abducted on the night of april 14 - 15 , 2014 , in the town of chibok , in northeastern nigeria , about a two - hour drive from the border with cameroon
the government girls secondary school had been closed for a month because of the danger posed by boko haram militants , who are opposed to western education , particularly for girls
but students from several schools had been called in to take a final exam in physics
the militants stormed the school , arriving in a convoy of trucks and buses and engaging in a gun battle with school security guards
then they forced the girls from their dormitories , loaded them into trucks and drove them into the forest
most have never been seen since , except in a photograph in which they sat on the ground in a semi-circle , clad in islamic dress
they were between 16 and 18 years old
police said the militants kidnapped 276 girls in all
about 50 managed to escape soon after they were abducted
those who did not , it is feared , may have been raped , brutalized , enslaved and forced to convert to islam
their parents were stricken with grief
on twitter , a hashtag began trending and spread around the world : # bringbackourgirls
on tuesday , malala yousafzai , the 17 - year - old pakistani girl who was shot in the face for speaking out in favor of girls ' education , sent a message to the kidnapped girls
" i am one of the millions of people around the world who keep you and your families foremost in our thoughts and prayers , " she wrote
" we can not imagine the full extent of the horrors you have endured
but please know this : we will never forget you
" one year later , a few things have changed
each of the missing girls has had a birthday in captivity
each is now a year older
nigeria 's current president , goodluck jonathan , was defeated in his campaign for re-election , in part , it is thought , because he failed to effectively combat boko haram
buhari , the incoming president , has pledged an aggressive effort to wipe out the group
but much remains unchanged , as well
boko haram still controls swathes of northeastern nigeria
according to unicef , 800,000 children have been forced to flee their homes because of the conflict between the nigerian military , civilian self - defense groups , and boko haram
amnesty international says women and children continue to be abducted
and it says boko haram continues to kill in large numbers
beyond that , more than 200 schoolgirls who had gathered one year ago to take their science exam are still missing
their families are still bereft
and tuesday on twitter , a hashtag was still trending : # bringbackourgirls .

nigeria 's president - elect sends nation 's prayers to families of girls
world still expresses hope that the girls will return
boko haram controls a portion of northeastern nigeria
