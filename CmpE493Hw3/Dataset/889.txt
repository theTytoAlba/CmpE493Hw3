discovery of the body of a young girl who may have been dead for weeks has led to the arrest of her teen sister -- herself a mother -- and a search for the girls ' parents , who may be in california with five other children , police in north las vegas , nevada , said
the investigation began wednesday when the 4 - month - old infant of the 17 - year - old was taken to sunrise hospital and medical center in suburban las vegas , authorities said
police arrested the teen mother on one count of child abuse with substantial bodily harm
she was taken to a juvenile facility
police department spokesman aaron patty told cnn affiliate kvvu that the " infant did not receive the proper care and nourishment that she needed at the time , which is what led to the arrest of the 17 - year - old
" a day later , a search warrant was served at the family 's home
that 's when police found the body of the 3 - year - old girl , who had apparently been dead " for at least a few weeks , " according to police
the teen mother was then arrested on one count of child abuse with death in connection with her younger sister 's death , according to a police statement
the parents left the home several months ago with the other five children , ranging in age from 1 to 9 years old , but , according to patty , " they left the 3 - year - old child and the 17 - year - old sister at the residence alone
" authorities are seeking the parents , 39 - year - old jondrew lachaux and 38 - year - old kellie phillips
police say the five children with them may be in danger
" we believe that they went to california at some time and may have gone back and forth during this multiple month process when they left , " patty said
no amber alert was issued , according to police , because the 4 - month - old did not die
lachaux and phillips , who are the child 's grandparents , are being sought for questioning
" we are asking for the assistance of the public in locating these two individuals , " said patty
" we believe they can answer many questions on what led up to the death of this child
" the 4 - month - old infant was last reported to be hospitalized in critical condition
her mother 's name was not disclosed .
