they were world war i soldiers , four of almost 2,000 , whose writings have recently been found underneath battlefields near naours , france , about 120 miles north of paris
photographer jeff gusky , who has been chronicling details of the site , describes the inscriptions -- and the underground city in which they were found -- as " breathtaking
" " this is a treasure trove , " he said monday night from his home in east texas , where he works as an er doctor
" even locally , no one realized what was there
" gusky , a national geographic photographer , has chronicled the area in a portfolio he calls " the hidden world of wwi
" the revelations of the underground city , which extends for miles in some directions , have come to light recently only because of a series of events , gusky said
the underground city actually dates back centuries but was sealed up in the 18th century
it was rediscovered in the late 19th century
during world war i , soldiers would take refuge in the carved - out rooms and pathways
the front was sometimes mere miles away ; the battle of the somme , one of the bloodiest in world history , was fought nearby in 1916
the land was privately owned for many years and generally off - limits to outsiders , said gusky , but it changed hands in 2013
the rights to operate it were purchased by a consortium of villages that wanted to promote awareness of the area 's history , he said
researching the city is a painstaking task
for one thing , it 's dark , so observers generally have n't realized what 's in there until they 've gone exploring
moreover , the maze - like extensiveness of the site has made discovery a slow process
" they go on and on and on
they 're so elaborate in some places , there are maps carved into stone so the soldiers would n't get lost , " he said
the graffiti looks like it was written yesterday , he added
gusky has noted 1,821 names
about 40 % are australian , with most of the others identified as british
fifty - five are americans , and 662 have yet to be traced
for gusky , the graffiti provides a human connection with men who lived a century ago
in many cases , they just wanted to be remembered , he said
" someone could be in this place one day and the next fighting at the front , " he said
leach , " merely a private , " was killed a month later in battle , gusky observed
" it could very well have been the last time he recorded his name as a living , breathing human being , " he said
