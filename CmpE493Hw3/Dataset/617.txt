was it politics or something else ? no one is sure , but the headstone of hillary clinton 's father , hugh rodham , was found tipped over this week , just a couple of days after she announced her run for the white house
" it was just laying down just right like that , boom , " paul mcgloin told cnn affiliate wnep
" i pass here five , six times a day because i live two blocks from here and when i looked i could n't believe it , to see that it was tipped over
" mcgloin said he 's tended to the grave site at the washburn street cemetery in scranton , pennsylvania , since rodham was buried there in 1993
police are investigating , but no other headstones were knocked over
police chief carl graziano told the scranton times - tribune that he suspects vandalism
" i 'm not sure how else it would have fallen over , " he said
still , police will look into the possibility that it was weather - related
funeral director neil regan also said vandalism is the most - likely cause , not the weather
" the more i thought about it , there were no serious winds or weather events , " he said
" paul mcgloin told me he had driven by here 8 o'clock ( monday ) morning and the stone was in place
" mcgloin believes it 's no coincidence that it happened within days of clinton announcing her second presidential bid
" and all of a sudden the headstone is tipped over , two days later , " he said
" as long as i`ve been coming here , the headstone has been pretty secure around the base of it
" cnn 's greg morrison contributed to this report
