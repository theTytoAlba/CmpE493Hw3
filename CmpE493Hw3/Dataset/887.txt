greenpeace activists have climbed aboard a shell oil rig to protest the company 's plans to drill in the arctic near alaska
the six protesters used ropes and harnesses monday to scale the huge platform in the pacific ocean , tweeting images of their daunting climb as they went
" we made it ! we 're on shell 's platform
and we 're not alone , " wrote aliyah field , an american activist taking part in the protest
" everyone can help turn this into a platform for people power ! " the rig , the polar pioneer , is on its way to the arctic via seattle
the environmental activists caught up with it about 750 miles northwest of hawaii , greenpeace said
they plan to occupy the underside of the rig 's main deck and say they have enough supplies to stay there for several days
shell did n't immediately respond to cnn 's request for comment late monday
but company spokeswoman kelly op de weegh told agence france - presse that the boarding was illegal and jeopardized the safety of the activists and the crew
greenpeace is furious over a decision last week by u.s. authorities to lift the suspensions on leases to drill for oil and gas in the chukchi sea , which lies between northern alaska and russia
shell and several other oil companies bought exploration leases for the sea in 2008
the u.s. government 's decision " means that in 100 days , shell could begin drilling in the alaskan arctic , " greenpeace said
federal agencies still have to review and approve companies ' plans before exploratory drilling can start
shell 's work in the arctic has suffered some setbacks in the past , including a drilling barge that ran aground off southern alaska on december 31 , 2012
greenpeace has repeatedly used the occupation of drilling - related vessels to bring attention to its cause
one group of its activists was detained for months by russian authorities in 2013
in the current episode , the activists pursued the polar pioneer , which shell is leasing from transocean , as it traveled thousands of miles aboard a transport vessel from malaysia , greenpeace said
besides the american protester field , the activists come from australia , austria , germany , new zealand and sweden
the u.s. coast guard was n't immediately available for comment late monday on the incident
cnn 's dave alsup contributed to this report .
