by the elation online and in the streets , you 'd think iran had just won the world cup
iranians erupted in celebration as young people waved flags from their sunroofs , blasted music from stereos and chatted online with the hashtag # irantalks
the excitement came after a breakthrough nuclear deal with the united states and other world powers that promises to end iran 's international isolation under years of crippling sanctions
just before midnight on thursday , vali asr street , one of tehran 's main thoroughfares , turned into something like a block party
men danced in the middle of traffic
some people flaunted u.s. dollar bills
it was a fitting double occasion : the agreement was struck on the final day of persian new year festivities , symbolizing a fresh start
milad , a 20 - year - old university student among the crowds , told cnn he was happy about the accord but wary about his own future
" i still believe i 'll have a hard time finding a job that pays well , with or without this deal
" another tehran resident , alireza , 37 , said " things ca n't get worse than they are so , i 'm happy with this news
" " this is pretty historic and i pray that my children will be able to live in an iran that can play nice with the international community
" at home that evening , families watched as iranian state television broadcast u.s. president barack obama 's speech live , which came for many as a surprise
some iranians celebrated the moment by snapping selfies in front of the tv
iranian foreign minister javad zarif — who led the iranian negotiation team — received a hero 's welcome as he arrived in iran on a sunny friday morning
" long live zarif , " crowds chanted as the vehicle rolled slowly down the packed street , carrying the man who struck the historic deal
other videos posted to social media showed zarif mobbed by fans in switzerland , who yelled " we love you , zarif ! " lausanne : zarif joins iranian students cheer " zarif we love you " outside press conference at # irantalks
