the idea of sustainable development is that raw capitalism is far too powerful for its own good
global capitalism is a juggernaut , with the world economy now doubling in size every generation
yet on a finite earth , with a billion new people being added every 15 years , that juggernaut is now laying siege to the physical bases of life and the social support systems that make life pleasant and decent
sustainable development offers a path out of this growing crisis
the reality is that raw capitalism is the economics of greed
unleash greed , the theory goes , and type - a personalities around the world will spend inordinate energy to organize businesses , invent new products , and thereby raise well - being
and in some sense , there 's a lot to say for this theory
after all , the world economy has expanded at least 100-fold since modern industrial capitalism first found its footing in britain around 1800 , and for most of the world , living standards have risen markedly along the way
yet history has also taught us that the " invisible hand " of the free market is a little less miraculous than it looks
instead , untrammeled greed also leads to massive fraud , mega-tax evasion , pervasive bribery , modern slavery , rising inequalities , and environmental destruction
perhaps most important , it feeds moral blindness
too many of the super-rich , whether they are calling for drilling in the arctic for oil or encouraging the cutting down of the rainforests for tropical hardwoods , simply deny the irreparable damage they are causing to the planet
it¹s no surprise that the wall street journal runs anti-environmental editorials on what feels like a daily basis
the environment is a nuisance and a hindrance to greed
and greed rules the moral order at the top of raw capitalism
novelists , ethicists , activists , unionists , preachers , teachers , and others have long known these facts , but the juggernaut has proved hard to tame
unleash greed as the supreme economic good , and it is greed that we get as the ultimate moral arbiter
sustainable development is a doctrine that says : let us once again place the economy on a true moral foundation and we 'll keep greed within bounds , ensuring the economic growth is combined with social fairness and environmental sustainability
the idea of sustainable development is that an economy must satisfy all three principles : economic growth , social fairness and environmental sustainability
yes , there can and should be economic growth , especially for today 's developing countries
human ingenuity and markets can indeed lead us to higher living standards and longer lives for all parts of the world , rich and poor alike
but these gains should be widely shared and should never be based on the exploitation of those at the bottom of society
social inclusion has been widely shown to improve societal progress broadly for all
and equally important , those gains should be based on true value added , not on the destruction of natural capital , whether through deforestation , climate change , or pollution of air , land , and water
thus , sustainable development calls for a holistic approach that combines economic , social , and environmental objectives
this balanced approach is much harder to achieve than the raw capitalism that places the economy above society and the physical earth
yet it recognizes that we are doomed to conflict and even collapse if we fail to promote social equality and environmental sustainability
just look at the recent news
last year was the earth 's hottest year on record , and another year of mega-storms , droughts , floods , and heat waves
major parts of the world , from pakistan and iran to california and brazil , are experiencing mega-droughts , and the prospect of catastrophic water scarcity in the future unless something changes
and even as the world economy grows and millions escape extreme poverty , our societies become more unequal , less trusting , and corrupt
all over the world , there is unrest on the streets even as our generation is the beneficiary of unprecedented technological knowhow and material progress
in my new book , the age of sustainable development , i¹ve not only analyzed the trends of growing inequality and rising environmental destruction , but have also shown how the concepts of sustainable development can be used to chart a way out of our growing crisis
it turns out that with goodwill , cooperation , greed kept in check , and technological savvy , we can build a modern global economy that is productive , inclusive , and environmentally sustainable all at the same time
the ongoing revolution of information and communications technology ( ict ) is an incredibly powerful enabler of new sustainable technologies
and doubters about the feasibility of sustainable development should have a look at scandinavia ¬ denmark , norway , and sweden , as they are the closest on the planet to achieving this trifecta of prosperity , fairness , and sustainability
consider the challenge of climate change , for example
big oil and wall street executives too often simply deny the science
yet a science - based sustainable development perspective shows that not only is human - induced climate change very real and very dangerous , but that it is also solvable at very low cost by switching over the next 30 years to electric vehicles , heat pumps , well - insulated buildings , smart ict - enabled grid , wind and solar energy , and other low - carbon and energy efficient technologies
if the world takes the time to do its homework and plan for the future , the world can bring the climate crisis under control and still enjoy a growing supply of quality energy services
and , more generally , although the u.s. political system still feeds untrammeled greed by enabling super-rich campaign donors and lobbyists to buy the political class , the american people and much of the rest of the world are coming to recognize the urgency of sustainable development
that is why governments around the world will adopt sustainable development goals ( sdgs ) this year , on the 70th anniversary of the united nations
these new sdgs will become markers and guideposts for building a world that combines prosperity , fairness , and environmental sanity -- a world we truly want and need for ourselves and our children .
