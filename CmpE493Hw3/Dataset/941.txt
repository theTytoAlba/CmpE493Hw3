japan 's space agency announced this week that the country would put an unmanned rover on the surface of the moon by 2018 , joining an elite club of nations who have explored earth 's satellite
the japan aerospace exploration agency ( jaxa ) , divulged the plan to an expert panel , including members of the cabinet and the education , culture , sports , science and technology ministry on monday
" this is an initial step and a lot of procedures are still ahead before the plan is formally approved , " a jaxa spokesperson told reporters
if it is approved , the agency will reportedly use its epsilon solid - fuel rocket technology to carry and deploy a slim probe -- the acronym stands for " smart lander for investigating moon " -- on the surface of the celestial body
japanese media estimates that the mission will cost in the region of ¥ 10 billion to ¥ 15 billion ( $ 83.4 million - $ 125 million )
jaxa spokesperson chihito onda confirmed to cnn that this estimate is realistic
the mission is expected to be used to perfect soft - landing technologies , which could be utilized in future , manned expeditions to the moon , or even mars
the lander will use face recognition software found in digital cameras , which will be repurposed to enable the craft to recognize craters on the surface , onda said
the move could be seen as japan 's attempt to play catchup to its asian neighbors china and india , which have both notched significant extraterrestrial victories in recent years -- china 's yutu lunar rover outlasted expectations and india successfully put a probe into orbit around mars the first time of asking
in 2008 japan put its selene craft -- known in japan as kaguya , after a japanese moon princess from a 10th century folk tale -- into orbit around the moon to gather data about its surface
the data gathered by the orbiter will also be used to calculate a suitable landing site for the rover
jaxa has also put a probe on an asteroid , which returned to earth in 2010
along with china , the united states and the former soviet union are the only other nations to have so far landed craft on the surface of the moon
