every morning , sissa abu dahou puts on traditional male dress , known as a jalabiya , and heads into the streets of the egyptian city of luxor for a day of hard work
but this man of the house is actually a woman
the grandmother of two has dressed as a man for 43 years to avoid oppression and eek out a living in the conservative muslim state
" why did you do this mother ? " her daughter asked during a recorded interview with egyptian television network cbc
" your father died and i was six months pregnant with you
" none of my siblings helped me
i raised you and sent you to school
without money i could not have gotten you an education
" a widow at just 21 , dahou was forced to fend for herself in egypt 's patriarchal south , where decades ago it was unheard of for women to earn their own living
even in recent years , women make up barely 24 % of egypt 's workforce , according to the world bank
" it is considered wrong that i dressed as a man but no one can judge
not you or anyone else
only god can judge me , " dahou said , " people talked but i said i decided to be a man so i can take care of my small daughter
" the breadwinner worked as a brick maker for just 25 piasters , the equivalent of a few cents , until she saved up enough money to buy a shoeshine kit
she found a place for her wooden box , painted with red hearts and the egyptian flag , alongside the all - male shoe shiners of her community
" if it was n't for my mother , i would have been on the streets " houda , her daughter , told tv host mona al - shazly through tears
" honestly i would have been in the streets
i did not find a home except with my mother
and even today my children rely on her
" the years of sun and sand weathered and darkened dahou 's face and left her with a voice so deep and raspy she can easily be mistaken for a man
her only child , houda , eventually married and had two children of her own
through the years the one - time housewife dreamed of owning her own business one day , a small street stand to sell snacks and cigarettes
after her interview on cbc television , the governor of luxor province offered dahou a kiosk and a cash advance
the maverick had one requirement - she would only agree to meet with the governor in male attire
" even if i die , i will not take it off , " dahou said as she pulled on the male jalabiya in front of a tv camera , " when i had to dress in a woman 's jalabiya when i went to cairo i felt suffocated
no , i thank god
i do n't want anyone to look at me or look at my daughter
" now the 65 - year - old who earned respect as a man has gained praise as a woman
egypt 's president , abdel fattah el - sisi , crowned her as one of egypt 's ideal mothers in an official ceremony last month
" if i was really a man , i would not have done this , " dahou told her daughter , " i would have gotten remarried
i would have left you who knows where
you would have been treated without dignity or left homeless
thank god i was able to protect you

sissa abu dahou recently was honored as one of egypt 's ideal mothers
but for 43 years she has dressed as a man so she could work in the conservative country
" people talked but i said i decided to be a man so i can take care of my small daughter , " says dahou
