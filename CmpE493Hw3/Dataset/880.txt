bring your own beaker , goblet or vase and slurp it up
7 - eleven is hosting the first bring - your - own - cup slurpee day at united states stores from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. saturday to kick off peak slurpee season
this shot at brain freeze is n't free , but customers at participating stores can fill their " cup " of choice for $ 1.49 , the average cost of a medium slurpee
note : a garbage can is not a cup
in - store displays with a 10 - inch - diameter hole will rule out anything too ridiculously large for slurpee consumption , and cups must be sanitary
but within those parameters , pretty much anything goes : " from sand buckets to trophies , customers can unleash their creativity by bringing in their choice of a unique , fun slurpee cup , " said laura gordon , 7 â€‘ eleven 's vice president of marketing and brand innovation , in a statement
the promotion is n't to be confused with free slurpee day , traditionally celebrated each july 11 .

bring your own large " cup " for a $ 1.49 7 - eleven slurpee
any sanitary container less than 10 inches in diameter is fair game
