the reserve deputy who shot a suspect with his firearm rather than his stun gun , and another deputy who can be heard cursing at the suspect after he was shot , were not in their normal states of mind because of the elevated stress of apprehending the suspect , according to a tulsa , oklahoma , investigator
tulsa police sgt. jim clark , who has been brought in to review the case , said tulsa county reserve deputy robert bates , 73 , " inadvertently " shot eric courtney harris after harris -- a possibly pcp - addled felon who had days prior sold methamphetamine to an undercover officer -- ran from authorities after trying to sell an illegal handgun during an undercover sting
as deputies tried to handcuff harris , bates arrived with a pepper spray gun in hand
he warned his fellow deputies he was going to use a taser on the suspect , but instead , he fired a single gunshot -- and immediately apologized , clark said , citing a recently released video
clark attributed bates ' actions to a phenomenon known as " slip and capture
" an example is when someone who drives a car with a manual transmission gets behind the wheel of a car with an automatic transmission
the driver will press her or his left foot down when stopping abruptly , even though there 's no clutch pedal , he said
quoting bill lewinski , executive director of the force science institute , clark further explained : " these are mistakes that are made when you think you are doing one thing but you actually are doing another , and the result often is directly opposite of what you intended
in effect , your intended behavior slips off the path that you want it to go because it is captured by a stronger response and sent to a different direction
" bates announced that he was going to deploy his taser , and he pulled the trigger only once , as he was trained to do , clark said
police are trained to " double - tap " when firing their handguns , he said
the gun jumped out of bates ' hand because he was n't expecting recoil , clark said , and bates expressed surprise and remorse that he had shot harris
quoting lewinski again , clark said , " this is the slip and capture
under time pressure to address a perceived threat , his intention to draw his taser slipped off his agenda , so to speak , when it was captured and completed by a more well - rehearsed motor program
... he was not conscious of this unfortunate switch until after the shot was fired
in his urgency , his concentration was focused exclusively on harris ' back , where he intended to place the taser darts
because of what 's called ' inattentional blindness , ' meaning that he was n't consciously paying attention to and registering it , he would n't have been aware that the feel of the gun was different from that of the taser
and in this case the weight of the gun and taser are nearly identical
" clark was emphatic that bates had done nothing criminally wrong and went so far as to say the reserve deputy was a victim
" reserve deputy bates did not commit a crime
reserve deputy bates was a victim , a true victim of slip and capture , " he said
" there 's no other determination i could come to
" when they set up the undercover sting , police wanted evidence on camera
but when they recorded the operation targeting harris earlier this month , cameras continued to roll as the suspect ran , and as he was fatally shot
the tulsa county sheriff 's office released the video on friday
the shooting was an apparent accident , it has said
in the last minutes of the video , harris lies on the pavement with police on top of him
an officer calls for a taser , but in place of an electric clicking sound , a gunshot rings out
a voice can be heard saying , " oh ! i shot him ! i 'm sorry ! " another officer screams out , " he shot him ! he shot him ! " harris , who is bleeding , calls out , too
he 's losing his breath , he says
an officer yells back at him
" you f * * king ran ! shut the f * * k up ! " he yells
" f * * k your breath , " he said
clark defended the officer 's language , saying the deputy experienced auditory exclusion , never heard the gunshot and thought the suspect was out of breath from running
the language has no bearing on whether the shooting was justified , clark said
" one deputy thought he was going to have to shoot this person at the arrest site
it 's very upsetting when you think you are going to have to take someone 's life and this deputy , one of the involved deputies , was upset , " he said
" secondly , this is total stress
they are going after a dangerous suspect that they have no idea whether or not this person is armed
" clark added , " they did not know that he was shot at this time
they was at a point where they could n't hear
they did n't even hear the gunshot go off
the officers did not know that mr. harris had been shot
" an officer can be seen in the video taking his foot off an object lying on the pavement not far from harris
shortly after the suspect is shot , the officers begin tugging harris ' hands behind his back as the video ends
harris later died at a local hospital
police said at the time of the shooting that harris admitted to medics at the scene that he may have been under the influence of phencyclidine , a street drug commonly known as pcp
the video is edited to block out the officers ' faces
minutes earlier , harris had climbed into a truck cab , where an undercover officer had set up a camera on the dash to record the suspect
" what 's up ? " they greet each other cordially
without missing a beat , harris rummages deep in a backpack and hastily hands over a semiautomatic pistol
every few seconds , he looks around outside nervously
" sweet , that 's a nice gun , man , " the undercover officer says off camera
it 's a " german luger , " harris tells him
he cranes his head around quickly and watches as a car pulls up next to the truck
officers in uniform jump out , and harris bolts out the passenger door and sprints off
" he 's running ; he 's running , he 's running ! " the officer in the truck says
as harris fled , police worried he might still be armed because he ran with his right forearm pressed against his hip , " consistent with trying to maintain control of a gun , " clark said , adding that no gun was found when harris was searched after the chase
another video from an officer 's body camera picks up the chase
the officer wearing it jumps out of a vehicle and pursues harris on foot , catching up to him easily
he tackles the fleeing suspect
the officer commands him , " i need you to roll on your stomach
now ! " other officers appear
someone calls , " taser ! taser ! " the gun discharges
much later in the recording made by the first camera inside the truck , two men are conversing
" he thought it was his taser , " one of them says , as the other curses in frustration
in the background , a woman is crying " no , no , no ! " harris had come to the sting deal with a female companion
police have said that harris had reached for his waistband , and officers feared he might endanger them
when harris was on the ground , he " refused to pull his left arm from underneath his body where his hand was near his waistband , " they said after the shooting
the officer 's body camera video did not reveal that area of harris ' body
bates , a former tulsa police officer , was placed on administrative leave after the shooting , the sheriff 's office has said
asked whether bates ' age may have been a factor in the shooting , clark said , " it 's happened to 21 - year - old law enforcement officers
it 's happened to 30 - year - old law enforcement officers
age is not really a factor in consideration for the dynamics behind slip and capture events
despite the details released over the weekend , harris ' brother says he still want answers
" i want to know if he was shot in the back accidentally or on purpose
these are all the things that not only i want , but the public wants , " andre harris told cnn affiliate ktul
bates ' attorney , scott wood , told cnn on friday he would contact the network later
he had not issued a statement or called back as of sunday
cnn 's jason morris , carma hassan and andreas preuss contributed to this report .

" slip and capture " explains why deputy shot suspect , investigator says
sheriff 's office says a reserve deputy thought he had pulled out a taser
instead , he shot the suspect , who later died at a local hospital
