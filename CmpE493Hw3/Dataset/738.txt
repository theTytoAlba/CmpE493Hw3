london time 's running out for britons to decide who they 'll back , as polling booths prepare to open across the country in an election that could change the political landscape
it 's been a blink - and - you - miss - it campaign , especially by u.s. standards , where candidates can take years to finesse their messages
the election could result in the handing of power from david cameron 's conservative government to the labour party , led by ed miliband -- or a frenzy of wrangling from leaders as they attempt to forge alliances with smaller parties
but that 's all to come when polls close late thursday evening , local time
very strict rules govern the reporting of uk elections , but until they kick in , here are some things you should know -- who are the candidates , what are the issues , who 's likely to win , why bacon sandwiches matter , what is " ukip " and , if the queen is n't in charge , what does she do ? the queen does n't run britain before we get on to the candidates , let 's dispel one common misconception
queen elizabeth ii is officially britain 's head of state , but she 's only nominally in charge
she signs off on legislation and appoints new prime ministers but has no real power , so no beheadings but maybe a few disapproving stares
officially , she 's politically neutral
the closest she apparently comes to expressing opinion is -- savor this image -- " purring " like a cat
visit : windsor castle , the queen 's country residence ( windsor and maidenhead ; +44 20 7766 7304 ) , royalcollection.org.uk / visit / windsorcastle so who are they voting for ? duh , they 're voting for a new prime minister
well , actually no. in presidential elections americans vote in each state for " electors , " who support the candidate they want to lead the country
but in a uk parliamentary the vote is more indirectly aimed at appointing a new government
voters put their " x " next to the local stooge / aspiring public servant from whichever political party they support
votes are tallied by constituencies -- political fiefdoms , really -- some of which date back centuries to when britain was run by barons , or maybe even elves -- each with a seat in parliament
the party that wins most seats then gets to say who becomes prime minister , pending the final thumbs up from her majesty
of course , in reality , people may be swayed by party figureheads and see voting as a direct endorsement of their leadership , personality or -- true things -- their ability to eat bacon sandwiches and point at fish
visit : hampstead heath -- a beautiful north london green space that lies partly within the hampstead and kilburn constituency , likely to be one of the most hotly contested of the election
( south hill park gardens , london ; +44 20 7332 3322 )
is that a fair system ? kinda
but also kinda not , since it means a party can easily win power without winning the most votes
that 's because britain 's elections are run on a " first - past - the - post " basis
it 's an analogy that highlights how similar british politics is to horse racing , just with fewer doping scandals
here 's how it works : the elected parliament consists of 650 seats , each representing a different number of constituents -- anywhere between 21,000 and 110,000
only the candidate who wins most votes in each constituency gets a seat
no prizes for second place
of course there have been reform demands from smaller parties stiffed by the system , but since they never win against the two main parties , they 're powerless to change anything
the centrist liberal democrats , for instance , had 6.8 million votes ( 23 % of the total ) at the last election , but won just 57 seats
the conservatives claimed 307 with just 10.7 million votes
visit : luskentyre beach , isle of harris
the stunning islands of the outer hebrides , off the western coast of mainland scotland , are part of the uk 's smallest constituency by voter numbers
visitscotland.com / info / towns - villages / luskentyre - sands so who 's going to win ? british elections are typically viewed as a two - horse race -- an analogy that highlights how similar they are to races involving two horses , only with fewer horses
the prime candidates are incumbent david cameron , head of the center - right conservatives , and ed miliband , leader of the center - left labour party
opinion polls say there 's no clear favorite
that 'll mean -- as it did in 2010 -- that the spoils of victory could be claimed by whoever can successfully horse ( yes , horse ) trade to build a majority coalition alongside smaller parties
if that happens , eyes will be on the smaller parties including the scottish national party , the liberal democrats and the upstart uk independence party
ukip 's leader nigel farage is a political outsider who 's won support for being anti-immigration , anti-europe and pro-beer
his party is n't expected to win many seats , but it could result in some unlikely romancing -- as the last vote did when the libdems hopped into bed with the conservatives , much to the anger of some supporters
enough with the horse analogies already
check out the real thing at the queen 's favorite track
high street , ascot racecourse , west berkshire , ascot.co.uk what are the issues ? there 's the future of britain 's cherished yet financially challenged national health service -- the free medicare system that 's undergone so many botched political procedures in recent years , it can barely bring itself to take off the bandages
ukip 's rise has spurred uncomfortable cross-party pledges to beef up controls to end decades of population - swelling immigration , a concern , apparently , among britain 's descendants of viking , norman , roman and anglo - saxon invaders
there 's the economy -- how to tackle britain 's budget deficit and foster financial recovery ( without relying on the cheap immigrant labor that the politicians want to stop entering
) and there 's europe -- another ukip - generated issue that has forced the main parties into posturing against the european union , even though many supporters suspect withdrawing would be disastrous , not just for the economy , but for future fish - pointing opportunities
visit : the white cliffs of dover , a potent symbol that marks britain 's frontier with the rest of the world
dover , kent ; +44 1304 207326 , whitecliffsofdover.co.uk think this all sounds too boring for words ? you 're not the only one , which is a major problem for the politicians seeking election
political apathy is on the rise in the uk , with many younger voters expressing disillusionment with party leaders they say are out of touch and barely distinguishable from one another , even if one " looks like a panda " and the other a " pink condom
" it does n't help the politicians ' cause when popular comedians such as russell brand denounce voting in favor of an as - yet unspecified " revolution
" however , he later changed his mind after meeting miliband , and urged people to vote labour
still , uk elections are n't without their entertainment -- most notably provided by fringe candidates
from 1963 until 1995 , a feature of every vote count was screaming lord sutch , an odd - looking pop star whose official monster raving loony party campaigned for many lost causes that later became reality , such as commercial radio and the scrapping of dog licenses
in the 2010 election other eccentric candidates included lord biro , who campaigned on policies that included the appointment of bono as pope
mad cap'n tom also pledged to train schoolchildren in " swordsmanship and gunnery " by imposing a 50 % tax on downloads of cheryl cole songs " because i hate cheryl cole
" whatever their motivation , come election night when they get their moment on stage with serious political rivals , they often get better laughs than brand
this charming english seaside town is where farage will be standing for election
among his opponents is al murray -- a comedian whose boorish stage character , " pub landlord , " shares many of the ukip leader 's views
