malala yousafzai 's stellar career has included a nobel peace prize
last week , she made it into outer space
a nasa astrophysicist has named an asteroid after the teenage education activist from pakistan , who was gravely wounded by a pakistani taliban gunman for promoting the right of girls ' to go to school
it took a meticulous medical response to save her life more than two years ago
but malala recovered with no serious neurological damage to become a powerhouse for her cause
after reading her story , scientist amy mainzer , who also consults for pbs on a children 's educational science show , decided malala deserved to be immortalized
so , she attached her name to the heavens
thousands of asteroids swarm through the solar system mainly between mars and jupiter
mainzer , working at the jet propulsion laboratory , discovered asteroid 316201 in june 2010 , which gave her the right to name it
" my postdoctoral fellow dr. carrie nugent brought to my attention the fact that although many asteroids have been named , very few have been named to honor the contributions of women ( and particularly women of color ) , " mainzer wrote in a note to malala
mainzer gave it the name 316201 malala , or 2010 ml48
malala 's asteroid circles the sun between mars and jupiter every five and half years , mainzer said
" it is about 4 kilometers in diameter , and its surface is very dark , the color of printer toner
" as a scientist , her support for malala 's work is logical
when girls around the world also get educations , it increases human potential
" we desperately need the brainpower of all smart people to solve some of humanity 's most difficult problems , and we ca n't afford to reject half the population 's , " mainzer wrote .

astrophysicist amy mainzer says she was was touched by malala 's story of determination
mainzer also works on educating children about science
