buzz has surrounded hbo 's new documentary " going clear : scientology and the prison of belief , " but scientologist john travolta is not a fan
travolta told the tampa bay times that he has not seen the documentary , " and i do n't really care to
" " i 've been so happy with my ( scientology ) experience in the last 40 years that i really do n't have anything to say that would shed light on ( a documentary ) so decidedly negative , " travolta said
the actor , one of the church of scientology 's most high - profile members along with stars like tom cruise and kirstie alley , is premiering his new film , " the forger , " in clearwater , florida
the hbo documentary is based on the book " going clear : scientology , hollywood , and the prison of belief " by lawrence wright and is critical of the organization , which has close ties to the showbiz industry
travolta said he believed the doc was a result of " people who were disgruntled with their experiences " with the church of scientology , which he touted as a positive experience for him
" i have n't experienced anything that the hearsay has ( claimed ) , so why would i communicate something that was n't true for me ? " travolta asked
" it would n't make sense , nor would it for tom ( cruise ) , i imagine
" he called scientology " brilliant " and credited the church with helping him to survive the death of his teen son , jett , after a seizure while the family was on vacation in the bahamas in 2009
" oh , my god , i would n't have made it , " said travolta , whose wife , kelly preston , is also a member
