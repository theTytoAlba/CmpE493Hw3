it did n't seem like a fair fight
on one side were hulking football players and pro wrestlers , competing as teams of two to eat as many pounds of steak as they could , combined , in one hour
on another was a lone 124 - pound mother of four
and sure enough , in the end , sunday 's contest at big texan steak ranch in amarillo , texas , was n't even close
molly schuyler scarfed down three 72 - ounce steaks , three baked potatoes , three side salads , three rolls and three shrimp cocktails -- far outpacing her heftier rivals
that 's more than 13 pounds of steak , not counting the sides
and she did it all in 20 minutes , setting a record in the process
" we 've been doing this contest since 1960 , and in all that time we 've never had anybody come in to actually eat that many steaks at one time , " bobby lee , who co-owns the big texan , told cnn affiliate kvii
" so this is a first for us , and after 55 years of it , it 's a big deal
" in fairness , schuyler is n't your typical 124 - pound person
the nebraska native , 35 , is a professional on the competitive - eating circuit and once gobbled 363 chicken wings in 30 minutes
wearing shades and a black hoodie , schuyler beat four other teams on sunday , including pairs of football players and pro wrestlers and two married competitive eaters
she also broke her own big texan record of two 72 - ounce steaks and sides , set last year , when she bested previous record - holder joey " jaws " chestnut
the landmark big texan restaurant offers its " 72 - ounce challenge " daily to anyone who can eat the massive steak , plus fixings , in under an hour
those who ca n't do so must pay $ 72 for the meal
schuyler , who now lives in sacramento , california , won $ 5,000 for her efforts
her feat will be submitted to guinness world records
but mostly , she just seemed pleased to enjoy a hearty meal on the house
" it 's free , so i 'm pretty happy about that , " she told kvii
" otherwise it would have cost me about 300 bucks
