kanye west has settled a lawsuit with a paparazzi photographer he assaulted -- and the two have shaken on it
the photographer , daniel ramos , had filed the civil suit against west after the hip - hop star attacked him and tried to wrestle his camera from him in july 2013 at los angeles international airport
west pleaded no contest last year to a misdemeanor count of battery over the scuffle
a judge sentenced him to two years ' probation , as well as anger management sessions and community service
ramos and his lawyer , gloria allred , sought general and punitive damages in the civil suit , saying that west had interfered with the photographer 's rights to pursue a lawful occupation
the case had been set for trial next week , but allred issued a statement tuesday night saying ramos ' side had filed a dismissal " because the case was settled to the satisfaction of the parties
" she did n't disclose the details of the settlement other than saying that " one important aspect of it was an apology by kanye west to our client , daniel ramos
" her statement included a picture of west and ramos shaking hands , which she said happened after the apology
the original incident was caught on video , including the following exchange
" kanye ! kanye ! talk to me , kanye ! " ramos shouts outside a terminal at the los angeles airport on the night of july 19 , 2013
" what 's ' going on ? why ca n't we talk to you ? i mean , why ? " he asks as west moves through a group of paparazzi
" now come on , kanye , i do n't want to fight with you , " he says as west advances toward him
" i told you , do n't talk to me , right , " west says
" you 're trying to get me in trouble so i step off and have to pay you like $ 250,000
" west is then seen rushing the photographer and attempting to wrestle his camera from his hands
west retreats after about 15 seconds of scuffling with the photographer
" we believe that this case sent an important message , " allred said
" celebrities are not above the law , and they have no right to physically attack someone simply because they were asked a question
" beverly hills police investigated an incident in january 2014 in which west was accused of assaulting a man at a beverly hills chiropractor 's office
west avoided criminal charges by reaching a civil settlement with the man
