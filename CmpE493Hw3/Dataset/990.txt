a north pacific gray whale has earned a spot in the record books after completing the longest migration of a mammal ever recorded
the whale , named varvara , swam nearly 14,000 miles ( 22,500 kilometers ) , according to a release from oregon state university , whose scientists helped conduct the whale - tracking study
varvara , which is russian for " barbara , " left her primary feeding ground off russia 's sakhalin island to cross the pacific ocean and down the west coast of the united states to baja , mexico
varvara 's journey surpassed a record listed on the guinness worlds records website
it said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190 - mile round trip between the " warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food - rich waters of the arctic and antarctic regions
" records are nice , but bruce mate , the lead author of the study , thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim
during her 14,000 - mile journey , varvara visited " three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales , " which was a surprise to mate , who is also the director of the marine mammal institute at oregon state university
" for her to go to mexico , " mate said , " it 's pretty strong evidence that it 's where she 's from
" varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale , but her ability to " navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive , " he said in the release , which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays
with only 150 western gray whales believed to be in existence , that number might be even lower
" past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species , but this suggests we may need to take a closer look , " mate said
