, but that sadness quickly transformed into anxiety when we looked inside our refrigerators and saw the potentially tainted culprit sitting there on the shelf
to assuage any fears , we asked john swartzberg , m.d. , a clinical professor at the university of california at berkeley , to walk us through the process of determining if our favorite dip was still safe to eat
related : amy 's kitchen recalls more than 70,000 cases of food due to fear of listeria contamination the first step , according to swartzberg , is to go to the food and drug administration 's website and find the official report for the recalled product you 're worried about
each report will list recalled items with their product codes , which are typically categorized by the universal product code ( the number adjacent to the barcode ) or the stock keeping unit ( a specific number that would only be valid at the store where the product is being sold )
they will also include the recalled products ' use - by dates , and the geographical areas affected
" the recall is not based on the use - by dates , though , " said swartzberg
" if the product is within the use - by date , it should still be recalled
this makes sense , because the product was contaminated prior to purchase and no matter how ' fresh ' the product is , it still may be contaminated
" after cross-checking these details , you should have a strong sense of whether your food product is safe to eat or needs to be trashed right away
but as far as avoiding potential problems before learning such details about a food recall , the consumer is at an automatic disadvantage

" discarding or returning the product to the store is all that can be done
" in the case of this specific hummus recall , while there was no evidence that it caused any consumer illness , the product 's routine sample last month revealed the presence of listeria monocytogenes
consuming such bacteria can lead to listeriosis , a serious infection , and dr. swartzberg recommends that anyone who has consumed a listeria - laden food should let their physician know as soon as possible
" listeria survives well at cool temperatures , " he said
" most bacteria and fungi do not -- that 's why we refrigerate
healthy people are at low risk for disease , but it can happen
those at greatest risk for disease are the elderly , immunocompromised and pregnant
