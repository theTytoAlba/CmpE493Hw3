johnson said he had no figure for the value of what was stolen
a former police official in london has speculated that the loss could run to 200 million pounds , or 300 million dollars , in a remark widely reported by news media
and numerous british news organizations put the value of the loss in the hundreds of thousands of pounds
but johnson said police were still identifying the owners of the ransacked safe deposit boxes and trying to contact them to learn what had been lost
people with knowledge of the area have speculated that cash and jewels were probably taken
some jewelry businesses reportedly stored some of their jewels in the boxes rather than leaving them in their stores over the holiday weekend

he said the floor was covered with dust and littered with safe deposit boxes and power tools
over the four - day easter holiday , an unknown number of thieves broke into the vault and might have been able to take as much as four days to rifle through the boxes
