robert downey jr. is making headlines for walking out of an interview with a british journalist who dared to veer away from the superhero movie downey was there to promote
the journalist instead started asking personal questions about the actor 's political beliefs and " dark periods " of addiction and jail time
twitter , of course , is abuzz : did journalist krishnan guru - murthy go too far ? must every interview be a license for a journalist to ask anything he 'd like ? from the start of the 7 - minute television interview , it seems evident that downey is not particularly interested in being there , even if being there was , ultimately , a benefit to him -- after all , he 's promoting his latest film , " avengers : age of ultron
" he grows increasingly agitated , even as the line of questioning remains on - topic ; his attitude , meanwhile , grew increasingly smug
his eyes glaze over as the reporter talks , he makes condescending comments and gestures that seem intended to intimidate and imply he 's much smarter than guru - murthy , and he repeatedly looks toward his handler as if to say , " do i really have to sit here with this guy ? " at one point , he makes fun of guru - murthy for seeming nervous , saying , " your foot is starting to jump a little bit
you better get to your next question
" but it 's after guru - murthy asks downey whether he thinks he is " free from all of that , " referring to downey 's history of " taking drugs , drinking " that the building tension comes to a head
" i 'm sorry , " says downey , " what are we doing ? " to which guru - murthy replies , " i 'm just asking questions , " which indeed was so
downey has the right to refuse to answer the question , of course , but that 's not what he does next
instead , he throws the celebrity interview equivalent of a tantrum : he smiles arrogantly , says " bye ! " and stands up to leave
he sure showed him ! it 's true that we live in a culture where we feel we have the right to know everything about celebrities -- who they 're dating , what they 're eating , where they vacation , what they meant when they made that comment 10 years ago
journalists often go too far , even if it 's their job
and certainly not every journalist is good at his job
but while downey may be understandably tired of answering questions about his past , questions that have been asked before , his business is our business
the entertainment industry is about entertaining people
as such , we tend to like to watch actors who seem like they want to be watched
this is why most celebrities , especially those with a big budget movie to promote , agree to interviews and seek out recognition in general
but when the recognition no longer serves them ? then they want to bemoan it ? what downey seemed to misunderstand is that the interview format gives journalists the right to ask questions
that 's what an interview is
he certainly can decline to answer questions he does not feel are appropriate , or even ones he simply does n't feel like answering
but he does not have the right to be absolved for behavior that is rude , demeaning , and disrespectful -- even if he 's a celebrity , and even if he felt uncomfortable or put - off
what the video shows is a movie star with a bullying streak
after he removes his microphone and his handlers begin hustling him out with kid gloves , the actor can not resist a parting shot
he turns to the reporter , being sure to look directly at the camera on the way , and says , " you seem okay
it 's just getting a little diane sawyer in here , " followed by what sounds like , " and you 're kind of a schmuck
" downey might not have been " in the mood " to be questioned ... and those days , those moods , are understandable
and yet in this case , that 's , well , too bad
the actor has agreed to an interview as part of his job
he has agreed to engage in a conversation with another professional human being
given the terms , he is not entitled to call all the shots
that he thinks he can is perhaps our own , celebrity - obsessed doing -- we revere the famous ; is it any surprise when they reveal that they , too , regard themselves as better than everyone else ? but it 's still on him .
