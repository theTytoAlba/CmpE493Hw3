he 's been part of a wildly popular superhero team since its very beginning
but there 's something we never knew about bobby drake , aka iceman of the x-men
wednesday 's issue of " all - new x-men " no. 40 reveals the truth : bobby is gay
" there are thousands if not millions of stories of people who , for many different reasons , felt the need to hide their sexuality , " brian michael bendis , who wrote the issue , said in a statement to cnn
" the x-men , with the conceit of time travel , give us a fascinating platform in which to examine such personal journeys
this is just the first little chapter of a much larger story that will be told
" iceman 's outing happens in an unusual manner
in the " all - new x-men " storyline , members of the x-men team travel to the past , as younger versions of themselves
mind - reading mutant jean grey ( also an x-men original ) asks bobby why he calls women " hot , " when she knows he is gay
in comic book pages provided to cnn , bobby does n't immediately acknowledge that she is telling the truth
the character of iceman is perhaps best known for his appearances in many of the " x-men " films , as well as the 1981 animated series " spider - man and his amazing friends
" the " x-men " series of comics have long been progressive in terms of diversity , with a black female character , storm , appearing in the 1970s , and the first gay mainstream comic book character , northstar ( who later married in the pages )
dc comics has also had prominent gay characters in recent years , like batwoman and the original green lantern of earth 2
catwoman recently came out as bisexual , and harley quinn is portrayed that way as well
bendis further shared his thoughts on twitter about the attention surrounding the story when it leaked on tuesday : " i swear on my dogs , i wanted the issue to come out and just be
oh , well ... "
