boston now the real boston marathon trial can begin
a federal jury 's decision to convict dzhokhar tsarnaev of 30 charges related to the 2013 boston marathon bombings was the most anticlimactic of anticlimaxes
the 21 - year - old 's lawyers admitted from the beginning that their client had participated in the horrific terrorist attack , which both scarred and strengthened this city
the outcome of this first phase may have been preordained , but nearly two years after the bombing , the trial has held boston and the region in thrall — more so than i might have imagined
the case regularly lands on the front pages of our two daily newspapers , the globe and the herald , and often leads the local television newscasts
the twitter feeds of reporters covering the trial are avidly followed
we have n't learned much new , although harrowing details about the deaths of the tsarnaev brothers ' four victims have come out
more than anything , many people find something cathartic in seeing the seemingly insolent , unrepentant tsarnaev being brought to justice
the only issue to be decided is whether tsarnaev should be executed
which is why the second phase of his trial is the one that really matters
was tsarnaev so thoroughly under the sway of his radicalized older brother , tamerlan , that he should be spared lethal injection ? or had this seemingly typical teenager transformed himself into a hardened jihadist who obsessed over al qaeda propaganda such as the article " make a bomb in the kitchen of your mom " ? what kind of justice should tsarnaev receive ? there is no death penalty in massachusetts , and in september 2013 , according to a globe poll , 57 % of respondents supported life in prison for tsarnaev ; just 33 % said he should be executed
by moving the case into federal court , u.s. attorney general eric holder made it likely that tsarnaev would receive the death penalty
keep in mind that no members of the jury were deemed eligible to serve unless they stated beforehand that they were willing to consider putting tsarnaev to death
but imagine a different scenario in which tsarnaev had been allowed to plead guilty in return for a life sentence
he would have been denied the public stage he has been granted ; although he has not testified ( so far ) , his terrorist actions have been replayed over and over again for people to see the world over
the 2015 boston marathon will take place in less than two weeks , on monday , april 20
thousands of runners will clog the 26.2 - mile route , and tens of thousands will cheer them on — as they did last year , proving to the world that we will not be intimidated
and tsarnaev 's lawyers will still be fighting for their client 's life
it is a natural if disturbing reaction to events like this that it 's easier to remember the names of the perpetrators than of their victims
but dzhokhar tsarnaev is a loser and a nobody
he should be allowed to fade away into the obscurity of a maximum - security prison cell
the people who deserve to be remembered are those he and his brother killed on marathon day — martin richard , krystle campbell and lingzi lu — and sean collier , the mit police officer they executed in cold blood
it is they who should live on in our collective memories .
