five years ago , rebecca francis posed for a photo while lying next to a dead giraffe
this week , she got threatened for her action
the trouble started monday , when comedian ricky gervais tweeted the photo with a question
" what must 've happened to you in your life to make you want to kill a beautiful animal & then lie next to it smiling ? " gervais wrote
in the past three days , his tweet has been retweeted almost 30,000 times
a number of people insulted and threatened francis in response to the giraffe photo and others featuring her
on the website rebeccafrancis.com , there are photos of francis with other animals , including a lion , which other twitterers responded to
francis , who has appeared on the nbc sports network outdoor lifestyle show " eye of the hunter " and was the subject of an interview with hunting life in late march , responded in a statement to huntinglife.com on tuesday , which was posted on its facebook page
the death came about , she said , because she was asked by others on an african hunt to " preserve " him for the local people
" ( the locals ) showed me this beautiful old bull giraffe that was wandering all alone
he had been kicked out of the herd by a younger and stronger bull
he was past his breeding years and very close to death , " she said
" they asked me if i would preserve this giraffe by providing all the locals with food and other means of survival
... i chose to honor his life by providing others with his uses and i do not regret it for one second
( the locals ) did not waste a single part of him
i am grateful to be a part of something so good
" according to the giraffe conservation foundation , there are about 80,000 giraffes in africa , a decline of 60,000 in the past 15 years
on a website called rebeccafrancis.com , where the photo is posted , francis describes herself as a longtime outdoors enthusiast and a fan of bow - hunting
" i prefer bowhunting , and the animals i have taken with a bow include : a 10 1/2 ft. brown bear , black bear , shiras moose , alaskan moose , dall sheep , stone sheep , desert bighorn ram , rocky mountain bighorn ram , mule deer , whitetail deer , elk , mountain goat , antelope , arapawa ram , kudu , zebra , black wildebeest , giraffe , springbuck , blesbuck , lynx , badger , and squirrel , " she writes
" i have also taken many of the same species and more with a rifle
" she has achieved the " full curl of north american sheep " with a bow , according to the hunting life interview , and hopes to achieve the " super 10
" the latter , according to liveoutdoors.com , " entails the taking of one animal from the ten basic north american species : bears , cats , deer , elk , caribou , moose , bison / muskox , goat , antelope and sheep
" tom opre , the producer and co-host of " eye of the hunter , " says she won the first season of " extreme huntress , " an online offshoot of " eye , " and co-hosted a handful of " eye " episodes
the rebeccafrancis.com website was apparently last updated in 2013 , though it makes mention of a 2015 tv series called " sheep shape " on the sportsman channel
cnn has reached out to francis for comment .
