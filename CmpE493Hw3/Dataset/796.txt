new delhi , india as the earth shook in nepal , tremors were felt over the border in india as well
it was a call to action : within hours of the first 7.8 magnitude quake , india began planning a massive cross-border aid mission
with each hour , the scale of the devastation in nepal became clearer -- some 3,862 people are known to have died so far -- and plans in india , where 72 people were also killed , got bigger
on sunday alone , india delivered 187 tons of supplies , including 50 tons of water , 22 tons of food and 2 tons of medicine
and there will be more to come
hundreds of trained disaster relief troops landed in kathmandu and quickly got to work
with each flight in , there was a flight back out , packed with indians and other nationals escaping to safety : 2,000 and counting have fled so far
by monday , india was in full - scale crisis mode : from airports across india , planes flew in loaded with aid , and trucks made the trip by land from india 's east , aiming for more remote areas
on the ground : devastation in nepal india 's prime minister narendra modi has made a special effort over nepal
he has visited the country twice in his first year in office
and on sunday , in his national radio address to the nation , he said indians needed to " wipe the tears of every nepali , hold their hands , and stand with them
" it all highlights the more proactive role taken by india in recent months
just weeks ago , india flexed its military muscle to rescue indians and other nationals from conflict - torn yemen
now , it is taking the lead in nepal
some might say india 's friendship is a signal for the other big country that shares a border with nepal : china
a display of hard power , perhaps to achieve enduring soft power in the region
but in times like this , help is always welcome
first there 's the immediate search and rescue operation , and then the long process of rebuilding work
nepal will need india 's friendship -- as well as china 's -- for many long months ahead .
