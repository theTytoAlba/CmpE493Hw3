the story of anthony stokes was supposed to have a happy ending
instead it ended tuesday , police say , with the teen heart transplant recipient carjacking someone , burglarizing a home , shooting at an elderly woman , leading police on a high speed chase and then dying after his car hit a pole
in 2013 , the teen 's family told media that an atlanta hospital rejected him for heart transplant surgery due to what the hospital described in a letter as stokes ' " history of non-compliance
" at the time , mark bell was acting as a stokes family spokesman
bell told cnn that a doctor told the family that anthony 's low grades and time in juvenile detention factored into the hospital 's decision to deny him a heart
" the doctor made the decision that he was n't a good candidate because of that , " bell said then
" i guess he did n't think anthony was going to be a productive citizen
" about a week after stokes ' story made headlines , children 's healthcare of atlanta gave him a heart
on tuesday , stokes carjacked someone at a mall , kicked in the door of a home in roswell , georgia , and fired a shot at an elderly woman , who called 911 , said roswell police spokeswoman lisa holland
stokes drove away in a black suv , she said
police spotted the car and ran its plates which showed it had been stolen
stokes lost control of the car , hit a pedestrian and then a pole , holland said
the vehicle was nearly halved , she said
the pedestrian is stable and in good condition , according to cnn affiliate wsb
stokes died at a hospital , holland said
in 2013 , stokes ' family provided media with a letter they said was from children 's healthcare of atlanta
" anthony is currently not a transplant candidate due to having a history of noncompliance , which is one of our center 's contraindications to listing for heart transplant , " it read
assessing compliance for potential transplant recipients is important because if a patient does n't strictly take all required medicines as directed , he or she could die within weeks of leaving the hospital , said dr. ryan davies , a cardiothoracic surgeon at the alfred i. dupont hospital for children in wilmington , delaware , told cnn
davies was not involved with this case
when stokes ' family was trying to get him a heart , the southern christian leadership conference advocated for the teen
sclc 's the rev. samuel mosteller told cnn that he was disappointed
" we got this young man a second chance in life , " he said
sclc referred the teenager to a mentor program in the atlanta area , but mosteller said that he was n't sure if the teenager participated
" what happened between the time in 2013 to now , i do n't really know , " he said
" how much anthony recognized the gravity of things and did what he needed to do to make himself a viable citizen , i do n't know
" cnn 's lauren leslie , marylynn ryan , elizabeth landau and jacque wilson contributed to this report .

in 2013 , anthony stokes ' family said a hospital refused him a heart due to his " history of noncompliance "

stokes shot at an elderly woman , hit a pedestrian with a stolen car and died in a police chase , authorities said
