atlanta it was a scene worthy of any top cop show on tv -- bullets flying , banged - up cars and the fbi chasing an armed robbery suspect
in the end , two agents were injured in a crash and the suspect was shot before being captured
fbi agents and task force officers were following 36 - year - old kevone charleston of austell , georgia , as he pulled into a cvs pharmacy in forsyth county , georgia , early saturday
charleston is suspected of involvement in 32 commercial robberies dating to november 2013 , according to fbi officials
" the incident all happened around 7 o'clock saturday morning , " said fbi special agent stephen emmett
" there were multiple agents and officers that were following him based on his prior mo , and when they saw he was about to rob another cvs , they moved in
" authorities say charleston parked his vehicle nearby and then popped the hood as if there were something wrong
then he walked to the cvs , preparing to enter
when agents confronted him , charleston ran , got in his car and traveled about 75 yards as agents opened fire
" there were several fbi vehicles that were rammed or were hit by the suspect 's vehicle when he was trying to flee
one government vehicle sustained heavy damage to its front and side , and another government suv ended up on its side
that 's how the two agents sustained their injuries , " emmett said

" charleston was shot and wounded by fbi agents and task force officers , but his injuries are not life threatening , according to forsyth county sheriff 's deputy robin regan
although he declined to give details of the 32 previous robberies , emmett said it was an intensive investigation that was already underway as a priority for the fbi 's violent crimes and major offender squad
