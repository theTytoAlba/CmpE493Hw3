you 'll see him in your mcdreams
on thursday night 's " grey 's anatomy , " dr. derek shepherd -- the hunky character played by patrick dempsey -- died
he was n't shot down over the sea of japan , nor did a helicopter fall on his head
instead , he died following a car crash -- after helping victims of another accident
" derek shepherd is and will always be an incredibly important character -- for meredith ( grey ) , for me and for the fans , " show creator shonda rhimes said in a statement , according to the hollywood reporter
" i absolutely never imagined saying goodbye to our ' mcdreamy
' patrick dempsey 's performance shaped derek in a way that i know we both hope became a meaningful example -- happy , sad , romantic , painful and always true -- of what young women should demand from modern love
his loss will be felt by all
" intriguingly , dempsey still has a year left on his contract
his character 's death leaves his tv wife , dr. meredith grey ( ellen pompeo ) , as the show 's mainstay as it concludes its 11th season in may
" it 's been a remarkable ride , " dempsey told tvline
" the worldwide impact has been extraordinary
it is incredible how devoted and passionate the fans are , and i will forever be grateful and humbled by the experience
" " grey 's " fans are still in shock
people magazine ran an obituary for the character
# mcdreamyforever was a trending hashtag on twitter
tweets from " grey 's anatomy 's " official account were filled with emoji of crying faces and broken hearts , as well as tearful images from the show
some chose to remember the good times , but for others , there was a big sense of betrayal
but the show will very much continue -- not only does it have a few weeks before the 11th season is over , pompeo is also signed through season 12
the theme of this season , rhimes had said , was grey 's ability to stand on her own
now without her husband -- who was already devoting his life to separate concerns as a presidential aide -- she 'll truly have to do so
" grey 's anatomy , " though not the powerhouse it was when it premiered in 2005 , still does well in the ratings
for the week ending april 19 , the most recent available , it was 20th in overall viewers and 12th among the desirable adults 18 - 49 demographic
and dempsey , who also races cars , is n't going anywhere
he has a development deal with abc studios , " grey 's " producers .

" grey 's anatomy " is in its 11th season
derek shepherd , played by patrick dempsey , died after a car crash
