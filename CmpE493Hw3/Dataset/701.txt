washington rick santorum says he 'd hoped indiana gov. mike pence would veto the " fix " to his state 's religious freedom law rather than limiting its scope
the law unleashed an intense backlash against indiana , led by tech giants like apple and salesforce and sports organizations like the ncaa , amid concerns it would allow businesses to turn away gay and lesbian customers
santorum , the former republican senator from pennsylvania , who is likely to mount another presidential campaign in 2016 , said on cbs ' " face the nation " on sunday that pence 's decision to sign a follow - up bill -- which made clear the law could n't be used to refuse services based on sexual orientation -- led to a " limited view " of religious freedom
" it does n't really open the debate up on some of the more current issues , " santorum said -- a reference to gay rights issues
with the supreme court set to rule in june on whether same - sex marriage should be legalized nationwide , social conservatives like santorum have asserted that christian bakers , florists and wedding photographers should n't be forced to provide their services to same - sex weddings
the indiana uproar drew nearly all of the gop 's 2016 contenders into the debate , with candidates like jeb bush , marco rubio and ted cruz rushing to pence 's defense
" tolerance is a two - way street , " santorum said
" if you 're a print shop and you are a gay man , should you be forced to print ' god hates fags ' for the westboro baptist church because they hold those signs up ? " santorum said
" should the government force you to do that ? " he said
" and that 's what these cases are all about
this is about the government coming in saying , ' no -- we 're going to make you do this
' and this is where i think we just need some space to say , ' let 's have some tolerance -- have it be a two - way street
' " gay rights groups , meanwhile , have used the outrage over indiana 's law -- as well as a similar one that arkansas gov. asa hutchinson signed into law -- and debate in at least 14 other states over similar measures this year to renew their calls for state laws that bar discrimination based on sexual orientation
sarah warbelow , the human rights campaign 's legal director , said the debate could shift to states like texas and south carolina , where similar bills have been introduced
she said tech companies like facebook and google are increasingly wading into the debate because they 're recognizing that " nondiscrimination protections are critical to every area of their employees ' lives
" cardinal timothy dolan , the archbishop of the catholic archdiocese in new york , said on nbc 's " meet the press " on sunday that the debate over religious freedom calls for a " delicate balance
" " we 've got to make sure that the rights of conscience and the ability to publicly exercise one 's religion is also balanced with another good -- namely , the rights of people not to be discriminated against , " he said
" it 's easier to ignore religious freedom than it is , today , the more popular issues , " dolan said
" in a way , i appreciate the fact that we have political leaders like gov. pence that are saying , ' whoa , wait a minute
without questioning the rights of the gay community , we also have to make sure that the rights of the religious community are protected
' " " i just wish we could do that in a temperate , civil way , instead of screaming at each other , " he said .

rick santorum says " religious freedom " debate is about government telling people what to do
