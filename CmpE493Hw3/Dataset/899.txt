oklahoma gov. mary fallin signed a bill on friday that would allow the state to perform executions with nitrogen gas if lethal injection is ruled unconstitutional or becomes unavailable
nitrogen causes a quick loss of consciousness and then death from lack of oxygen , fallin 's office said in a press release
cnn affiliate kfor says it 's never been used in an execution in the united states
" the person will become unconscious within eight to 10 seconds and death a few minutes later
in other words , a humane , quick and painless death , " said rep. mike christian , one of the bill 's authors , according to kfor
robert dunham , executive director of the death penalty information center , told the washington post that the same " painless " argument had been used to advance the use of lethal injections
" the hasty manner in which this bill sped into law reflects the same lack of care with which oklahoma has managed its execution process historically , " he said
oklahoma 's executions have been put on hold while the u.s. supreme court reviews its use of lethal injections
last year , the state came under scrutiny when it took 43 minutes to kill convicted killer clayton lockett
fallin reaffirmed her support for the death penalty
" oklahoma executes murderers whose crimes are especially heinous , " fallin said
" i support that policy , and i believe capital punishment must be performed effectively and without cruelty
the bill i signed today gives the state of oklahoma another death penalty option that meets that standard
" the governor 's office said the first alternative for execution is lethal injection , followed by nitrogen gas , the electric chair and the firing squad .

nitrogen gas causes a quick loss of consciousness and then death from lack of oxygen , oklahoma says
the state 's executions are on hold while the u.s. supreme court reviews the state 's use of lethal injections
