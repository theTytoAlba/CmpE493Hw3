tuesday , april 14 , is equal pay day
here 's the announcement presidential candidate hillary clinton should make : " today in america , women earn on average 77 cents for every dollar men earn
and the gap is even greater for women of color
as president , my top priority will be fixing inequality and ensuring that 100 % of the population is paid 100 % of what they 're worth
and so , i 'm announcing that if elected president , i will take a 23 % pay cut , equivalent to the current gender wage gap , to stand in solidarity with working women in america
and i wo n't take a raise until every woman in america gets a raise , too
" april 14 was n't just chosen at random as equal pay day
it 's based on a calculation : for women to make the same amount of money that men made in 2014 , they 'd have to work until april 14 , 2015
a woman on average loses $ 431,000 in pay over the course of a 40 - year career
merely closing the gender wage gap would pull half of working single moms out of poverty
and at a time where republicans are still , bizarrely , trumpeting more tax breaks for business and the rich to stimulate the economy , closing the pay gap would put money in the pockets of working people who would actually spend and stimulate real growth
the new women warriors : reviving the fight for equal rights so here 's the perfect opportunity for hillary clinton to put her money where her mouth is , literally
in her campaign launch and personal rebrand , clinton is clearly trying to portray herself as a woman of the people , a populist fighter for the middle class
" everyday americans need a champion , " clinton said in her campaign launch video , " and i want to be that champion
" clinton has deftly put her finger in the wind and sensed the winds of populism blowing through america
indeed , the fact that many democratic voters still clamor for a less pro-war , less pro-wall street , more elizabeth warren - like alternative to clinton is an ever - present thorn in the otherwise blooming garden of clinton 's inevitability
opinion : the myth of equal pay day with her video , clinton has signaled a clear desire to ground herself and her candidacy in the soil of populism
but can a wealthy white woman who once sat on the board of walmart , has already lived in the white house , collects six - figure speaking fees and does n't seem to own a pair of jeans really inhabit the portrait of a populist fighter ? this is where a good ol ' - fashioned political stunt would come in handy
and make no mistake about it , i 'm recommending a political stunt
let 's call a spade a spade
hillary clinton is a very rich person
while she 's certainly not the first rich person to run for president , her wealth -- and the related perception of being out of touch with ordinary americans -- is an obstacle in her candidacy
the difference between the current standard presidential salary of $ 400,000 a year and the 77 cents - on - the - dollar version of that salary , or $ 308,000 , is probably a drop in the bucket in clinton 's bank account at this point
and yet the symbolic power is profound
because what clinton would be reminding us is that across america , the aggregate salaries of all working women is 23 % less than the aggregate salaries of all men
78 cents on the dollar : the facts about the gender wage gap thanks to the hacked sony emails , we saw that even top female stars and executives in hollywood are paid less than their male counterparts
what more powerful message could the potential first female president send than literally signifying that nationwide inequity in her own salary ? clinton would n't just be saying she stands with the working women of america , she 'd be showing it
is it offensive to suggest that the first female commander in chief should be paid 23 % less than her male predecessors for doing exactly the same work ? yes
and that 's the point -- to use her status to highlight the offensive gender wage gap and what clinton , as president , would do to fix it
yes , such stunts are trite and theatrical
they 're also effective , especially in our increasingly short - attention - span , it - only - happened - if - you - can - tweet it , symbolism - over - substance culture
politics used to be about clunky people ( mostly men ) debating complex policies
now it 's about polished memes and even more polished candidates
policy ( i hope ) still matters , but we 're as likely to debate a candidate 's " image " as her or his " substance
" the truth is that stunts and theatrics are now part and parcel of politics , as they are in our culture in general
that does n't mean they ca n't also serve a noble purpose , in highlighting important problems and inspiring solutions
map : where the gender pay gap is the widest clinton did an arguably brilliant thing in her campaign launch , framing her video and presidential bid as not about her but the american people
in fact , clinton did n't even appear in the video until the very end -- it was all about middle - class americans , working hard , trying to get by and get ahead
and then we see hillary , who wants to help
hillary clinton ca n't change who she is , the baggage attached to her by both the right and the left , rightly or wrongly
but she can change what she does going forward , how she shows up and signifies herself as a voice not for the status quo and the establishment -- but for ordinary americans who need change
if clinton wins , her presidency will indeed be symbolic and historic
and it will be significant if she does something to change the lives of the 158 million women in america .

sally kohn : april 14 is equal pay day , and hillary clinton should make an announcement about wage gap
clinton should say that if elected , she will take a 23 % pay cut to stand in solidarity with working women
