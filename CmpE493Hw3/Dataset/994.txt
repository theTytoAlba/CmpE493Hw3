and white walkers , but what can fans expect sunday as we head into a fifth season of one of the most popular shows in hbo history ? it 's the most high - profile premiere yet , airing simultaneously in 170 countries for the first time
( hbo is a time warner company , like cnn
) we sought out " thrones " aficionado doug gross , a writer for nerdwallet and a former cnn employee , who had a few thoughts on the matter ( beware , tv fans , he has read the books )
" we 're going to start seeing some of the show 's major story arcs coming together , " gross said ( as confirmed by the executive producers )
" already , stannis has shown up at the wall to save jon snow and the rest of the night 's watch from the wildlings , " he said
" now we 'll see how his quest for the iron throne collides with the watch 's supposedly non-political role protecting the realm
" tyrion 's path should cross with daenerys ' this season , according to the trailers
" season five also will be unique in that some of the major story arcs will clearly be moving ahead of where george martin is in the ' song of ice and fire ' books , " gross pointed out
executive producer david benioff told rolling stone , " we are starting to build to a crescendo , which means the battles have to get bigger and things have to get more dramatic
" indeed , this fifth season means we 're past the halfway point , with the show currently set to end after seven years
the stark daughters , arya and sansa , will be the characters to watch this season , as will cersei
the world of westeros is constantly plagued by war , but is there a time when people have just had enough ? " wars are waged by the nobles , but it 's the common folk who suffer , " gross noted
" and , this season , we 'll get a glimpse of what happens when those common people have had enough

the smash hit series " game of thrones " returns for a fifth season sunday
major story arcs should start to converge this year
