some fans of lucille ball want her statue removed from a park in her hometown , saying the " ugly " likeness does not do justice to the " i love lucy " star
the life - size bronze statue in celoron , new york , has been likened to conway twitty , the snake from " beetlejuice " and actor steve buscemi , among other unflattering comparisons
even mayor scott schrecengost has gone on record saying he does not care for the statue , which shows the comic star holding a bottle of fictional nutrition elixir vitameatavegamin
and yet , it has been a tourist draw since 2009 for celoron , the comedian 's birthplace , attracting visitors who pose with the statue for pictures
a resident of jamestown , where ball grew up , started the facebook page in 2012 " we love lucy ! get rid of this statue , " seeking to get rid of the " ugly " statue
a story about the group on yahoo! news this week spread through the internet , reviving debate over what to do with the statue
the founder of the facebook group would like to see the statue replaced with a new one outside a planned comedy hall of fame in jamestown , home to the lucy - desi museum & center for comedy and the annual lucille ball comedy festival
the founder requested anonymity , saying the issue is " not about me ; it 's about the statue
" " lucille ball was one of the most talented , beautiful , funny women who ever appeared on television ; a pioneer , a giant of television
my only goal is to have a sculpture of her in jamestown which does her justice , " the group 's founder told cnn
" this statue in celoron is not fixable
i love my hometown and i love lucy
let 's get a new statue that is a real tribute to her memory as the comedy queen of television
" a buffalo news columnist vouched for the sentiment , saying " its deranged grimace and jagged teeth inspire more dread than reverence
" " no one here much likes the statue , and one look tells you why
it looks more like an extra from ' the walking dead ' than arguably the most famous comic actress of all time , " colin dabkowski wrote saturday
still , residents take pride in their claim to fame , " even if some of them privately wish that the statue commemorating her would be struck by lightning
" the artist who created the statue did not respond to cnn 's request for comment
in a post this week , the facebook group founder said the point was not to " disparage " the artist or his work
but , in this case , " this lucy statue is just not up to his usual work
" schrecengost told the local post-journal that he reached out to the artist over the years about redoing the statue
" he finally came back and said he wanted $ 8,000 to $ 10,000 to do it
i 've also reached out to several other sculptors in the region , and some said they would do it , but we 're still looking at about $ 5,000 , " he told the newspaper
" we 'd like to work with the original sculptor and wish he would stand behind his work enough to step up and fix it for free
