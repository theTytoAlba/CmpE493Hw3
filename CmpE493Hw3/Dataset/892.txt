pushed to his limits , a college professor took the extreme measure of threatening to fail his entire class
in an email to his students , irwin horwitz accused them of " backstabbing , game playing , cheating , lying , fighting
" the professor at the texas a&m university galveston campus expected his missive would create some conflict , but that it could then be resolved quickly -- and quietly
those hopes were dashed when one report by local media mushroomed into a tornado of nationwide coverage
suddenly , his name was spreading on twitter , facebook and reddit , accompanied by the kind of strong , unvarnished opinions that you can make about people you 've never met
he was a hero who taught today 's entitled youth a much - needed lesson , or an egotistical nightmare of a teacher who threw a fit
one thing was certain : he , and his employer , were now thrust into a spotlight that neither had asked for
" i did what i did without any intention of seeing this in the news or seeing this on the internet , " horwitz said
" i will stand by what i did , but i 'm not career suicidal
" texas a&m says horwitz remains an employee and that no one has asked him to stop teaching
but horwitz , a nontenure - track professor in the maritime administration program , is afraid the notoriety will cost him this job and future jobs
horwitz said his intent was not to be controversial , and the sharply worded email to students was not his first about the class
the day before writing to his students , horwitz wrote a similar email to the ceo of the texas a&m galveston campus and to the school 's chief academic officer
" i have never in my capacity as an academic ever encountered a class as completely disgraceful , dishonest and disrespectful " as his current strategic management class , he wrote to the administrators
he accused the students of shirking responsibility , making excuses and complaining their way to better grades
he would no longer teach the course and would fail the entire class , horwitz wrote
" the class of graduating seniors is nothing more than a circus that is anything but academic , " he wrote
" but they are your problem now
" it was the next day that horwitz wrote to the students , calling the class " an embarrassment in general , " and said that " i am frankly and completely disgusted
" once his words echoed in traditional and social media , the narrative -- angry prof flunks entire class -- might as well have been set in stone
the story was such a talker that even the onion offered a parody
" i 'm not looking to fail students , " horwitz said
" i do n't get a bonus for failing students
" " the letter sounded a little bit more definite than i wanted it to , " he added
he never actually changed anyone 's grade
there were some students he was n't going to fail , he said , and some who were on the border who could have pulled themselves out
but horwitz stands by his tough stance ; there was an issue of competency and of professionalism that had to be addressed , he said
the course in question is a capstone course for a maritime administration degree and is supposed to merge what the students learned in their other business courses
" i had a large majority of people taking the capstone course who could not do a break - even analysis , " the professor said
" if you can not do a break - even analysis , then you do n't deserve a bachelor 's degree in business
" his other complaint was about professionalism
horwitz said students would swear at him , cheat and spread rumors about him online
this is related to their grades , he said , because dealing with people you do n't like is a business skill
on online message boards , users claiming to be students in the class accused the professor of exaggerating the situation or fabricating parts of his story
one purported student called horwitz " a little obnoxious , " but said he is a good teacher and fair if you follow his rules
should the professor have been surprised that his email went viral ? the fiery language and strong allegations were likely to be news if the email went public , but maybe there is more to it
the situation hits on a popular argument on the media and internet : what do we think of millennials ? reflecting on his most recent class , horwitz said there is some truth to stereotypes of millennials as entitled and pampered
he mentioned the overdependence of students on cell phones and other electronics , and the power those devices have to interrupt concentration
the other factor is a failure of k - 12 education , said horwitz , who has met college students who do n't know how to convert fractions to decimals
" what i 'm trying to do is to give an honest assessment of their performance , " he said
in a statement , patrick louchouarn , the vice president for academic affairs and chief academic officer at texas a&m galveston campus , said the entire class will not be failed
" each student will receive an individual grade based upon work completed during the semester , " louchouarn said
" the university is listening to concerns about this issue from students and faculty and will address them according to our policies
" the flurry of attention is unwelcome and horwitz fears it will affect his career in academia
but it 's likely his story will have a short shelf life
people probably will forget about it and turn their attention to the next grabby headline
but he said he thinks this episode will follow him everywhere
he said he feels a public shaming of sorts
online public shaming has become a research topic of its own
people who have been pilloried online for comments they made wonder if they will get a second chance
" this is really destroying my life , " horwitz said .
