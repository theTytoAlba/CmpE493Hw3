the powers of marvel 's all - star superheroes go a bit wobbly in " avengers : age of ultron
" faced with the daunting prospect of topping the surprise and excitement of 2012 's the avengers , the third highest - grossing film of all time , writer - director joss whedon mixes some brooding down - time in with the abundant spectacle
to be sure , series junkies will get their fix from the sheer massiveness of the exploits , but at least two of the big action scenes are lackluster , while the climax and resolution could have been worked out in more complex , less rote ways , so as to further increase intrigue and anticipation for " avengers : infinity war parts 1 and 2 , " already scheduled for release in may of 2018 and 2019 , respectively
not that any of this will matter much , since the pent - up excitement among the enormous international fan base is so intense that nothing will keep the summer 's presumed biggest franchise blockbuster from soaring to and beyond the one - billion dollar threshold internationally
hands - on producer kevin feige and his associates have built a cinematic empire quite unprecedented in hollywood history , a veritable solar system of staggeringly profitable individual franchises unified by the overpowering collective force of the avengers
so while sideline enterprises like the new " daredevil " tv series continue to pop up , the company can be so confident in the enduring appeal of its theatrical mainstays that it recently published a release schedule for its remaining big - gun commercial titles from now through the end of the decade
at this point , no one would be willing to bet on when a sense of terminal deja vu might set in to bring it all to an end , and comic - con can plan its main events years ahead
in the meantime , the key points of interest surround how many surprises and twists can be wrung from a format and set of expectations that demand great fealty from core fans ; any significant deviations are taken as personal betrayals by the hardest - core geeks
last summer , " guardians of the galaxy " showed that marvel could play it a bit more fast and loose than it generally does , but the big - name franchises still seem sacrosanct
and so it is with " avengers : age of ultron , " which at moments takes a peek down some shadowy side roads but ends up mostly zooming along the main highway to deliver what the audience wants rather than something even a little bit different
picking up where last year 's " captain america : winter soldier " left off , the new film , without preamble , dives right in to show the avengers dispatching the remnants of the nasty hydra organization in a hectically and indifferently staged forest combat scene that leaves clint barton / hawkeye ( jeremy renner ) worse for wear while also introducing two new adversaries , twins pietro and wanda ( aaron - taylor johnson and elizabeth olsen )
victory allows for some passably amusing scenes of the heroes blowing off steam : the favorite party trick of thor ( chris hemsworth ) is to challenge all comers to lift up his hammer ; natasha / black widow ( scarlett johansson ) and bruce banner / the hulk ( mark ruffalo ) pursue a little mating dance in which her amorous interest is predicated upon his retaining his human rather than superhero form ; and tony stark / iron man ( robert downey jr. ) and steve rogers / captain america ( chris evans ) take stock of the advances their old nazi nemesis strucker ( thomas kretschmann ) appears to be making in the artificial intelligence department , specifically with the most sophisticated humanoid ever devised , ultron ( voiced with marvelous robotic nuance by james spader )
what 's behind warner bros. ' risky move to release nine movies ultron is a cool and sophisticated creation ; what he lacks , of course , is a heart , which is what makes him such an imposing villain
a sleekly designed robot you might even call handsome , he makes an excellent intellectual and smart - ass sparring partner for stark , but when he first appears , he 's still on training wheels
however , he does recruit pietro and wanda to his cause , an easy matter since stark killed their parents
he 's not yet entirely ready to conquer the universe but , in their first skirmish with him , the avengers are sufficiently outclassed to begin worrying
could ' star wars ' open at $ 500 million ? licking their wounds at the " safe house " of hawkeye 's farm , the avengers go into a funk
the impatient thor quickly takes off " to find answers , " bruce resists natasha 's desire to get something physical cooking between them ; stark , lamenting that " ultron is tryng to tear us apart , " consults with old cohort nick fury ( samuel l. jackson , briefly ) , while mad men 's linda cardellini , playing hawkeye 's stand - by - your - man wife , is stuck with the ( intentionally ? ) funniest line of dialogue in the film : " you know i totally support your avenging
" while some of his partners wallow in disarray , captain america heads for seoul , where the next evolutionary step is to emerge via a device called " the cradle , " which will hatch mass - produced android soldiers that will pave the way for ultron 's world domination
but a major chase through the city involving a runaway subway train falls flat due to basic conceptual silliness and poor action continuity
of course , the avengers ultimately get it together to do the kind of butt - kicking they 're supposed to do , and a very welcome addition to the team comes in the form of the android called vision
red - faced and green - garbed , vision is given a striking profile and overall presence by paul bettany ( heretofore limited in the marvel world to vocal work as stark 's computerized butler j.a.r.v.i.s. ) , and it can be hoped , if not assumed , that this most intriguing character will play an even more important role in the final two avengers installments
' galaxy quest ' tv series in the works ultimately , whedon 's efforts to invest the heroes with a degree of uncertainty and vulnerability comes off as half - baked , as such an effort can only go so far due to the nature of the material
after all , these are comic book characters defined by their double identities ; a third dimension is neither required nor perhaps even desired
if ending on a dramatic cliffhanger note had been desired , the elements were there for the taking ; including a semi-tragic component along with mystery about ultron 's ultimate fate would arguably have only further cranked up anticipation for the coming chapters
but , then , what does that matter when the automatic attendance of millions is assured ? " avengers : age of ultron " succeeds in the top priority of creating a worthy opponent for its superheroes and giving the latter a few new things to do , but this time the action scenes do n't always measure up and some of the characters are left in a kind of dramatic no - man 's - land
the returning series actors acquit themselves in the expected agreeable manner , while series newcomer andy serkis has a terrific couple of minutes as a tough but stressed south african criminal
