andrew lesnie , the oscar - winning cinematographer who spent more than a decade collaborating with director peter jackson on the six " lord of the rings " and " hobbit " films , has died
the sydney native , who also worked with new zealander jackson on the remake of " king kong " ( 2005 ) and " the lovely bones " ( 2009 ) , suffered a heart attack monday
said a spokesman from the australian cinematographers society : " we have been advised of the sudden death of andrew , " adding that his family would provide an official statement later
known for balancing technology with artistic considerations , lesnie also shot " rise of the planet of the apes " ( 2011 ) , directed by rupert wyatt
the cinematographer recently polished off the water diviner , the directorial debut of russell crowe , another new zealand native
that movie opened friday in u.s. theaters
said crowe on twitter : " devastating news from home
the master of the light , genius andrew lesnie has passed on
" lesnie won his oscar for his work on the first of the fabled " lord of the rings " trilogy , " the fellowship of the ring " ( 2001 )
his knack for getting the right feel of author j.r.r. tolkien 's most foreboding locales was remarkable
for the inaugural " lord of the rings " film , jackson reached out to lesnie after seeing his work on " babe " ( 1995 ) and its 1998 sequel
those australian films , revolving around a pig and other animals , featured impressive visual effects and proved to be big hits at the worldwide box office
" i 'd never worked with him or even met him before , but he 'd shot the babe films and i thought they looked amazing , the way he 'd used backlight and the sun and natural light to create a very magical effect , " jackson said in a 2004 interview
" and babe had that larger - than - life feel about it that i wanted
" so when we began looking for dps in early 1999 , i first decided to get either an australian or new zealand dp , as they 'd be used to the way we make films , " jackson continued
" every country is slightly different in that way , and i immediately thought of andrew
" lesnie 's impressive body of work also includes the post-apocalyptic science fiction film " i am legend " ( 2007 ) , directed by francis lawrence and starring will smith ; " the last airbender " ( 2010 ) , from m. night shyamalan ; and healing ( 2014 ) , helmed by craig monahan
