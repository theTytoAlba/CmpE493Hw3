it would have made thomas jefferson proud
established on the birthday of the american founding father , liberland -- the world 's newest micronation -- is founded on a firm belief in liberty and noninterference from the powers - that - be
a tiny , 7 square - kilometer parcel of land , marked on maps as gornja siga , its territory abuts the danube on the border between serbia and croatia
the victim of a border dispute between serbia and croatia , it is claimed by neither side -- effectively a no - man 's land
no one lives on this patch of land , which is heavily forested and contains only badly - maintained access roads and a run - down house , abandoned for decades
this is where euroskeptic czech politician vit jedlicka stepped in
on april 13 he planted his newly - designed yellow and black flag in the territory , declaring the area the free republic of liberland -- a tiny sliver of a country , bigger only than the vatican and monaco
he tells cnn that the country will be formally founded on may 1 and is inviting , through the media , the world 's heads of state to attend a formal ceremony marking the presumptive nation 's birth
he says that he will also invite 7,500 of the 300,000 applicants that applied to become citizens of liberland to the ceremony , where he will grant them citizenship
" i will grant citizenship if they can make it to the party , " he told cnn by phone
" it 's short notice but a good challenge , and also for the presidents ( and other heads of state ) if they can make it to the founding of our country
" jedlicka , an active member of the czech republic 's party of free citizens , opposes excessive government interference
he says his attempts to enact change in his home country led him to the political experiment that is liberland
" i would describe it as a global revolution
it 's just the beginning , " he tells cnn via skype
founded on staunchly libertarian principles -- its motto is " to live and let live " -- its website describes its system of governance as being a " constitutional republic with elements of direct democracy
" it will use a form of cryptocurrency -- similar to bitcoin -- as its national currency , bypassing the need for a central bank and will , according to its constitution , keep government 's noses out of everything possible , from the banks to prostitution
" liberland prides itself on personal and economic freedom of its people , which is guaranteed by the constitution , which significantly limits the power of politicians so they could not interfere too much in the freedoms of the liberland nation , " the world 's newest constitutional document states
financial regulation will be minimal , if at all present
jedlicka says almost 300,000 applications for citizenship have been received , about 20 of which have been accepted
" thousands of americans , swiss people
also a lot of arabic peoples who feel oppressed by the regimes there
" he envisions , ultimately , a community of around 35,000 liberlanders , not all of whom will be full - time residents
he says he expects trouble from his neighbors , whose land he has effectively annexed
" from serbia , croatia , we expect some trouble but we expect international laws will applied and any movement against us would be an attack on a sovereign nation , and we will offer nothing but passive resistance
for now , ( though ) we will make roads , docks
" for its part , the serbian ministry of foreign affairs released a statement to cnn that stated that liberland would not theoretically impinge upon its border , which is delineated by the danube , but " the ministry also considers this a frivolous act which needs no further comment
" croatia 's counterpart was similarly dismissive
" virtual quips , however interesting they occasionally sound , remain what they are -- virtual quips , and for them we have no official comment

vit jedlicka , the first president of liberland , tells cnn that the country will be formally founded on may 1
on april 13 , jedlicka declared an area between croatia and serbia " the free republic of liberland "
jedlicka says that almost 300,000 applications for citizenship have so far been received
