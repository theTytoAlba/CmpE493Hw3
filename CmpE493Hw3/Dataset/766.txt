more than 22 months ago , the body of odin lloyd was found in an industrial park in north attleboro , massachusetts
lloyd had been shot seven times near a pile of construction waste
the semipro football player for the boston bandits was 27
days after he was found dead , then - nfl star aaron hernandez was arrested and charged with murder
testimony in the case against hernandez began in january
on wednesday , a fall river , massachusetts , jury -- after deliberating 35 hours over the course of seven days -- found the former new england patriots tight end guilty of first - degree murder , which carries a penalty of life without parole , as well as unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition
hernandez also faces murder charges in a 2012 double homicide
he has pleaded not guilty
just two years ago , he was one of the nfl 's most promising tight ends , inking a $ 40 - million contract extension with the new england patriots
friends and fans alike wondered : how could the star player who had more than 900 receiving yards in 2011 now be on trial for murder ? long before hernandez made national headlines , he was a standout athlete in bristol , connecticut , who came from a family described as a local sports dynasty
" i do n't think there was another family that was more familiar in bristol , " bob montgomery , who covers high school sports for the bristol press , told cnn
the young hernandez was the " golden boy , " playing football , basketball and running track , following in the footsteps of his uncle , older brother and father -- all well - known athletes in the community
hernandez 's father constantly pushed his son , requiring him to practice for hours before he could go out with friends
" i saw a closeness with them that i 'd never seen before , " montgomery said of the relationship between hernandez and his father
but his father , the man who kept the 16 - year - old anchored , died from complications after a routine surgery
hernandez left high school halfway through his senior year in january 2007 to join the university of florida gators , and trouble seemed to follow
in just his first semester , a police report says , hernandez got into a fight at an off - campus restaurant , sucker - punching the manager and rupturing his eardrum
the following fall , there was a shooting near a local club
police reports linked hernandez and several other university of florida football players to an argument in the parking lot
hernandez was one of more than 20 people interviewed by police , and he was the only one who did not make a statement after invoking his right to counsel
at the time , hernandez 's mother told the orlando sentinel newspaper , " i know he was at the club , but he never saw any shooting
" the case remains open , and no one has been charged
hernandez was also suspended at least once for marijuana , an issue that would follow him as he entered the draft his junior year
trying to put the alleged drug use behind him , hernandez wrote a letter to the patriots director of personnel
" if you draft me as a member of the new england patriots , i will willfully submit to a biweekly drug test throughout my rookie season
... in addition , i will tie any guaranteed portion of my 2010 compensation to these drug tests and reimburse the team a pro-rata amount for any failed drug test , " he wrote , according to the boston globe
before the draft , hernandez was expected to be a first - or second - round pick
he was passed over until the fourth round , when the patriots selected him
by the end of his second season , he was a bona fide star , landing the $ 40 million contract extension
less than a year after signing the deal , however , the patriots dropped him on the day he was charged with lloyd 's murder
when odin lloyd pulled up in a black chevrolet suburban , boston bandits coach mike branch thought something was out of place
lloyd did n't own a car
aaron hernandez case : who 's who ? branch had his suspicions , but he could n't get answers
lloyd was too busy telling his friends about the good time he had at the club the previous night
" he said he was at the club with mr. hernandez , and that they were partying and he had a good time , and that mr. hernandez spent a good amount of money , " branch recalled
lloyd said hernandez spent about $ 10,000 that night
lloyd 's friends say he was n't a big partier
he was more passionate about football and family
remembering odin lloyd lloyd was dating shaneah jenkins , the link between the young man who dreamed of the nfl and the all - american who made it
jenkins is the younger sister of shayanna , who 's engaged to hernandez and is the mother of his little girl
on june 16 , 2013 , lloyd was riding with friends in the black suburban , which police later learned was rented by hernandez
daryl hodge was with lloyd when he said lloyd got a text from hernandez , asking to hang out later that night
as they parted ways , lloyd told hodge he 'd see him later
the next day , lloyd 's body was found
prosecutors say lloyd was last seen with hernandez and hernandez 's two associates , carlos ortiz and ernest wallace , around 2:30 a.m. in a rented silver nissan altima
surveillance video from security cameras at an industrial park showed an altima heading toward a secluded area at 3:22 a.m. at the same time , chilling text messages from lloyd 's phone were sent to his sister telling her he was with " nfl , " adding , " just so u know
" between 3:23 and 3:27 a.m. , workers nearby reported hearing gunshots
at 3:29 , a camera showed an altima pulling into hernandez 's driveway , about a half a mile from the death scene
three people got out of the car , and lloyd was not one of them
nine days later , hernandez was arrested and charged with first - degree murder and other weapons - related charges
in april 2014 , ortiz and wallace were also charged in lloyd 's slaying
they , too , pleaded not guilty
prosecutors say the three men were to be tried in a joint venture , a legal term that means it 's not necessary to prove who pulled the trigger as long as there is evidence that each defendant actively participated in lloyd 's murder
as the trial for the death of lloyd neared , lawyers began arguing about evidence , including cell phones and text messages
some rulings were victories for the defense
the jury would n't see the text lloyd sent to his sister , telling her he was with " nfl
" the judge ruled it hearsay and said the state had n't proven lloyd believed his life was in danger
jurors also did n't hear anything about what happened in boston on july 16 , 2012 -- the night two men were murdered outside a club where hernandez had been
the judge agreed with defense lawyers that it 's far too prejudicial and irrelevant to lloyd 's murder
investigators allege hernandez shot and killed daniel abreu and safiro furtado because one of the men bumped into him on a nightclub dance floor and spilled his drink
district attorney patrick haggan described the scene in a massachusetts courtroom in may , saying hernandez became " angered and increasingly agitated , particularly after mr. abreu smiled and did not apologize
" prosecutors : bump , spilled drink led to double homicide hernandez 's friend tried to calm him down , and the pair walked outside and eventually entered a second club across the street , the prosecutor said
court documents identify that friend as alexander bradley , who would go on to accuse hernandez of shooting him in the eye in an incident that would take place seven months later
after leaving the second nightclub , hernandez and the friend returned to their suv and pulled over on a nearby street where hernandez removed a revolver from the engine block , haggan said
hernandez began trailing abreu , furtado and three of their friends in his suv , authorities said
he then pulled up to the victims ' car at a red light and leaned out the driver 's side window with a loaded revolver , haggan told the court
hernandez allegedly said , " yo , what 's up now , " followed by a racial slur , and fired at least five rounds from a .38 - caliber revolver , haggan said
abreu , the driver , was shot several times and fatally hit in the chest
furtado was sitting in the front passenger seat and suffered multiple gunshot wounds , including one to the head , haggan said
hernandez was charged in the double homicide in may , and he pleaded not guilty
investigators found evidence they believe links him to the 2012 slayings while investigating the death of lloyd
