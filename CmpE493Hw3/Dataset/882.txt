mogadishu , somalia gunmen stormed the headquarters of somalia 's education ministry in the country 's capital on tuesday after a suicide car bombing , a two - pronged attack that killed at least 12 people and injured 16 others , officials said
the islamist militant group al - shabaab is responsible for the attack in the center of mogadishu , group spokesman abu musab said
the attack began when two suicide bombers detonated their car at the entrance of the two - story building housing the ministry of education , culture & higher education , somali national security ministry spokesman mohamed yusuf said
five gunmen then entered the building , shooting people inside , yusuf said
security guards at the building , and , later , somali special forces battled the gunmen inside , witnesses said
soldiers from the african union , who are in somalia in part to support the government 's fight against al - shabaab , teamed up with somali security forces to shoot and kill the five attackers , yusuf said
the attack killed four somali soldiers and eight civilians , according to yusuf
the special forces helped people out of the building while the attack was underway , city police capt. mohamud abdi said
ali hassan , a man who was helped from the building , confirmed that a rescue operation was happening inside
somalia - based al - shabaab has battled the country 's government for years , aiming to overthrow it and turn the nation into a fundamentalist islamic state
in recent years , the group also launched terror attacks beyond somalia 's borders , sometimes targeting non-muslims
what is al - shabaab , and what does it want ? earlier this month , al - shabaab gunmen stormed garissa university college in neighboring kenya , killing 147 people , mostly students
the terrorists separated christians from muslims and shot those who could n't recite verses from the quran , witnesses said
in somalia , al - shabaab has been blamed for attacks that have killed international aid workers , journalists , civilian leaders and african union peacekeepers
late last month , al - shabaab militants detonated a bomb and sprayed bullets at a mogadishu hotel , leaving at least 20 people dead in an attack that lasted a number of hours
among those killed was yusuf mohamed ismail bari - bari , somalia 's permanent representative to the united nations in geneva , switzerland
