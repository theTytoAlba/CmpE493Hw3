how will the new " fantastic four " differ from the original movie of a decade ago ? for starters , as a new trailer shows , sue and johnny storm 's father initiates the project that ends up giving the foursome their powers
they also end up in another dimension , and we see the early flirtation between sue storm and reed richards as well

) the movie is first in the rampaging - dino franchise since " jurassic park iii " in 2001
