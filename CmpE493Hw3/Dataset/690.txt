if you 're famous and performing the american national anthem , be prepared to become a national hero or a national disgrace
just ask vince , whitney , roseanne , jimi and michael
mötley crüe 's vince neil reminded us again this week of the dangers of tackling " the star - spangled banner
" sure , he can shred it on " girls , girls , girls " and " dr. feelgood , " but this is a different story -- a completely different story
to say neil butchered the song before the las vegas outlaws arena football league game would be unkind to those in the profession
there 's less carnage when butchers are done with their work
the late whitney houston set the modern standard for the national anthem at super bowl xxv
in the early stages of the gulf war in 1991 , a patriotic america saluted her performance
just six months earlier , comedian roseanne barr may have established the low - water mark
the crowd at the san diego padres game booed her rendition and president george h. w. bush called it " disgraceful
" there 's nothing quite like getting the presidential thumbs down
one of the most controversial and beloved versions of " the star - spangled banner " comes from 1969
guitar slinger jimi hendrix inflamed mainstream america with his psychedelic take on the national anthem to the delight of the woodstock generation
and then there 's michael bolton 's version
overly wrought songs are his specialty and he does n't disappoint in that department when he sings at the american league championship series in 2003
bolton belts it out , but there 's one little problem -- the words
can anyone say crib notes ?

singing the national anthem is a risky proposition
whitney houston nailed it ; roseanne barr destroyed it
