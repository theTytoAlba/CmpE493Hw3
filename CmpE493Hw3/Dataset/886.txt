washington an iranian military observation aircraft flew within 50 yards of an armed u.s. navy helicopter over the persian gulf this month , sparking concern that top iranian commanders might not be in full control of local forces , cnn has learned
the incident , which has not been publicly disclosed , troubled u.s. military officials because the unsafe maneuver could have triggered a serious incident
it also surprised u.s. commanders because in recent months iranian forces have conducted exercises and operations in the region in a professional manner , one u.s. military official told cnn
" we think this might have been locally ordered , " the official said
the incident took place as the u.s. and other world powers meet with iran in switzerland to negotiate a deal limiting tehran 's nuclear program
at the same time , iran has been active in supporting proxies in several hotspots in the persian gulf and neighboring regions
the navy mh - 60r armed helicopter was flying from the deck of the uss carl vinson on a routine patrol in international airspace , the official said
an unarmed iranian observation y - 12 aircraft approached
the iranian aircraft made two passes at the helicopter , coming within 50 yards , before the helicopter moved off , according to the official
the official said the helicopter deliberately broke off and flew away in a ' predictable ' manner so the iranians could not misinterpret any u.s. intentions
the navy helicopter was in radio contact with the ship during the encounter , but there was no contact between the two aircraft and no shots were fired
the navy crew took photos of the incident but the military is not releasing them
the u.s. administration is considering a potential demarche protest against iran , the official said
cnn has reached out to iranian officials but has not received a response
this type of iranian observation aircraft generally operates over the gulf several times a month
but after the recent incident , u.s. naval intelligence did not see it again for two weeks , leading to the conclusion that the incident may have been ordered by a local commander who was then reprimanded by higher - ups
the pentagon has noted for the last several years that most encounters with the iranian military at sea or in air are conducted professionally , but that some missions run by iranian revolutionary guard corps forces have been too aggressive against u.s. forces in the area
the u.s. military 's concern has been that one of these incidents could escalate into a military encounter
this incident " might have been buffoonery " the official said , but there is always a risk from such actions
the incident comes as the navy patrols the gulf of aden to watch for iranian ships the u.s. believes are trying to bring weapons to resupply the houthi rebels in yemen
the navy would share such intelligence with saudi arabia , a second u.s. official told cnn .
