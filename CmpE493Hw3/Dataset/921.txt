the new emojis are here ! on thursday , apple released a new version of its mobile operating system that includes more diversity than ever when it comes to the race , ethnicity and sexual orientation of its emojis -- those cute little images that users can insert into text messages or emails when words alone just wo n't cut it
the reaction to this new lineup is , as should be expected with almost anything new in today 's hypersensitive climate , a range of cheers and jeers
why is any of this important , you may ask ? for many , these images are far more than tiny clip art for texting
rather they are seen as recognition that their own ethnicity , sexual orientation , race or even hair color is part of mainstream america -- despite what others might say
this matters in a digital age where texting is how most people communicate and represent themselves dozens -- if not hundreds -- of times every day
think receiving a text of an image of a person smiling
or more accurately , think of a white face smiling because up until thursday 's update , all the emojis had pale skin
but that has all changed
now there 's a range of emoji skin tones to pick from , including yellow , brown and black
i 'm sure few people will be upset with this development
but how about in december ? why ? now that will be able to choose the skin tones for each human emoji , and that will also include ... santa claus
that shrieking sound you may have heard was from fox news ' megyn kelly , who famously stated in 2013 that santa claus is absolutely , definitely and without a doubt a white guy
in fact , thanks to apple , we may even see brown santa emojis this december
( could that mean he 's a muslim santa ? ! cue even more shrieking from fox news
apple has now given us gay and lesbian couple emojis , kissing with a heart over their heads
this inclusiveness was cheered by at least one gay news service on twitter
it 's not yet clear if a person who likes to use same - sex kissing emoji couples can be denied service by a person who objects on grounds of " religious liberty
" but it would be interesting to hear what any of the 2016 gop presidential candidates might have to say about " gay emojis
" and i would predict some conservative will claim that the kissing gay emojis will turn children gay
the fact is , when you embrace diversity , you will still leave out other minority groups
redheads , for example , are pretty pissed off because there are no emojis featuring their hair color
in fact , supporters of a redheaded emoji have started a petition that has already garnered several thousand signatures
even expanding the flags represented by emojis , as apple has done , comes at some peril
apparently canada is overjoyed that finally apple has included it
but armenians are not happy they were left out
i must admit that being partially of palestinian heritage , it 's heartening to see that despite the fact that some refuse to recognize a palestinian state , apple has chosen to now include a palestinian flag emoji
armenia , i feel your pain
of course the bigger question in the whole diverse - emoji issue is : what took apple so long ? how hard could it have been to add different skin colors to pick from ? that the company ( finally ) did is a step in the right direction : america 's demographics are changing , so our representations of who we are -- even representations as tiny as emojis -- should reflect this
apple has " evolved " in showing diversity -- from brown people to same - sex couples
maybe " religious liberty " conservatives who discriminate will follow .

dean obeidallah : apple 's new emoji lineup is diverse in race , ethnicity and sexual orientation
it 's just like america , but what took apple so long ? obeidallah asks
he says change may rankle ( or win over ? ) conservatives who discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation
