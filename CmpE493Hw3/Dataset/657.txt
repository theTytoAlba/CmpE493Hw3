i 'm haunted by the video of officer michael slager firing eight shots at walter scott as he fled his encounter with north charleston police -- his back turned to the officer
what i find more disturbing is how the officer cuffs the fallen scott and allows him to die face - down in the dirt while slager appears to plant an item next to his body
i understand why people are skeptical of self - defense claims -- especially from law enforcement
if not for the video taken by a bystander , i ca n't help but think that this story would be shuttered behind the wall of an active investigation
as a defense attorney , i am more sensitive than anyone to the assumption of innocence for those accused of a crime , but this single piece of evidence -- a video of a man shot in the back while in full retreat -- defies any reasonable explanation
thank god there was a camera
it will help ensure that justice will be served in this case
however , there is another camera that -- had it been deployed -- might have prevented the entire tragedy : a police body camera
throughout the entire encounter with scott , it 's clear slager had no idea someone was filming him
had he known there would be video of his every move , would he have drawn his weapon on a fleeing man ? would he have fired ? eight times ? would he have misrepresented the encounter on his police report ? of course not
if slager had been wearing a body camera , scott would probably still be alive , and slager would n't be facing the possibility of life in prison -- or a possible death sentence
body cameras are expensive to deploy , sure
and storing the massive amounts of data that body cameras create costs even more
that cost , however -- if we 're talking the monetary kind -- may be eclipsed by the punitive damages delivered to scott 's family in an inevitable civil suit against the north charleston police department
most importantly , we have to ask ourselves this : what 's the value of a human life ? certainly it 's worth the price of some mass data storage
and there 's something else at stake
the public is losing confidence in law enforcement , and the strained relationship between minorities and police is reaching a breaking point
every police shooting that captures headlines justifies an ever increasing fear of cops in the street
as fear ratchets up , so does the tension between cops and the people in the communities they serve
as tension rises , the risk of more shootings increases
it is a cycle of destruction that could lead to chaos
police body cameras can help break this cycle
studies have shown that both cops and people in the community act better when they know they are on camera
complaints against cops decrease , and , most importantly , use - of - force incidents drop
i will admit that body cameras are only an interim solution
they only help compensate for the real underlying problem , which is this : there is a bias against black men that has infiltrated the criminal justice system , and we are seeing it in the disproportionate shooting of black men
when we look at this footage -- and when we see the dashboard camera from the other south carolina officer who last year shot a man who was reaching for his driver 's license -- it 's clear that many cops are more likely to interpret actions , even routine actions , from black men as potentially aggressive
these may not be overtly racist cops
they may not intentionally treat black men differently , but we ca n't pretend that black men are n't being disproportionately targeted
all across the country , we see it happening , and with the proliferation of video , we 're seeing it happen with alarming frequency
somehow , we 're going to have to beat this bias out of our system
set tougher employment screening standards when hiring cops
institute more training to help officers recognize the bias and adjust for it
as a society , we have to focus on the broad social changes needed to address disparities in income , education and opportunities -- disparities that keep us a racially divided nation
but social change , sadly , may take generations of hard work
in the meantime , if we ca n't immediately root out racial bias , we can at least put a bright spotlight on it , and we can start by focusing on the one interaction where racial bias results in the loss of life -- we can start by placing body - mounted cameras on cops .

mark o'mara : video captured michael slager shooting walter scott ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired
o'mara says such cameras are expensive , but cheaper than wrongful death payouts -- and the cost of a human life .
the underlying problem is racial bias in policing ; until that 's solved , body cameras are a good interim solution
