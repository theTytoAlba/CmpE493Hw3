tokyo the operator of the crippled fukushima daiichi nuclear plant has given up trying to recover a robotic probe after it stopped moving inside one of the reactors
tokyo electric power company ( tepco ) deployed the remote - controlled robot on friday inside one of the damaged reactors that had suffered a meltdown following a devastating earthquake and tsunami in 2011
it was the first time the probe had been used
the robot , set out to collect data on radiation levels and investigate the spread of debris , stalled after moving about 10 meters , according to a statement released by tepco
a newly released report and footage from the robot shows that a fallen object had blocked its path and left it stranded
tepco decided to cut off the cable connected to the device sunday as it had already covered two - thirds of the originally planned route
it managed to collect data on radiation levels in 14 of the 18 targeted locations
four years after the devastating nuclear crisis , the radiation levels inside the three damaged reactors are still extremely high and remain unsafe for people to enter
decommissioning work is estimated to cost $ 50 billion and will take years to complete
tepco called the robotic probe an " unprecedented " experiment
