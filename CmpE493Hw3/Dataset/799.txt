roseanne barr revealed earlier this week that she is going blind
in an interview with the daily beast , the 62 - year - old comic talked about her struggle with macular degeneration and glaucoma — two eye diseases that get progressively worse over time and can steal vision
barr 's doctors have n't provided a timeline , but her symptoms are worsening : " my vision is closing in now , " she said
" i just try and enjoy vision as much as possible
y'know , living it up

( barr said in the interview that she helps relieve the pressure by using marijuana , which is known to temporarily lower pressure inside the eye
) " it 's somewhat unusual that roseanne bar has both , but not unheard of , " explains ophthalmologist steven a. shanbom , md , of shanbom eye specialists in berkley , mich. though there are some controllable risk factors , certain people are genetically predisposed to these diseases , so barr may simply be prone to both
" certainly it 's sad
the combination of the two is terrible
macular degeneration takes away her central vision , and glaucoma is taking away her peripheral vision , " dr. shanbom adds
( he is not treating roseanne barr , and does not know the specifics of her case
) the risk for both diseases goes up for everyone after age 60 , with some people , especially african americans , at higher risk in their 40s
that 's why the american academy of opthalmology recommends getting a baseline eye exam when you turn the big 4 - 0 , even if you have perfect vision
in the early stages , you can have either condition , but have no symptoms at all
things like a family history or high blood pressure , or issues within the eye ( like having a thinner cornea , for example ) might lead your md to prescribe drops that can reduce your chances of developing glaucoma by about half

but like those eyedrops , there are treatments that may delay the progression of early - stage glaucoma ( from other drugs to surgery ) , and therapies that might halt further vision loss in advanced cases of macular degeneration ( including an implantable telescope )
the future looks brighter however : an animal study published this month suggests that an injection of stem cells into the eye might slow or even reverse the effects of early - stage macular degeneration
there are also simple things you can start doing right now to ward off these diseases
here , five ways to protect your peepers
slip on your shades — even when it 's cloudy sun exposure can up the risk for glaucoma and macular degeneration , as well as cataracts ( clouding of the lenses )
make sure your sunglasses offer 99 % to 100 % uv protection
sporting a pair that does n't filter uv light is more dangerous than wearing no shades at all , because the dark lenses cause your pupils to dilate and allow in more harmful rays
schedule in a regular walk studies indicate that aerobic exercise can reduce the eye pressure that leads to glaucoma , and may improve blood flow to the retina and optic nerve
according to the glaucoma research foundation , all you need to do is raise your pulse 20 % to 25 % ( which could mean a brisk walk ) for 20 minutes , a minimum of four times a week

another good source : egg yolks
snack on almonds , citrus , and berries almonds are loaded with vitamin e ( a handful provides about half your daily dose ) , which slows macular degeneration ; while citrus fruit and berries are filled with vitamin c , which cuts your odds of developing the disease
avoid cigarette smoke while smoking is bad news for many parts of your body , you may not have considered eyes to be one of them
however , smoking doubles your risk of macular degeneration
avoiding cigs can not only protect your lungs and heart , it can protect your peepers too .
