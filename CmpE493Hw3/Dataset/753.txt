australia , an important ally of the united states , has agreed to share some of its intelligence with iran
australian foreign minister julie bishop said the deal is " an informal arrangement " with an emphasis on tracking australians who go to iraq to fight for isis
but one australian lawmaker reportedly described the move as " dancing with the devil
" over the weekend , bishop became the first australian government minister to visit iran in 12 years , meeting with president hassan rouhani
the intelligence - sharing deal was announced in an interview released monday that bishop gave to the australian broadcasting corporation while in tehran
" during my discussions with the national leadership here , it was agreed that we could share intelligence , particularly on the foreign terrorist fighters from australia who are taking part in this conflict in iraq , " she said
the iranians " were very agreeable to share that information with us , " she added
like many western nations , australia is grappling with the problem of citizens who are choosing to travel to iraq and syria to join isis , which calls itself the islamic state
australia is part of the u.s. - led coalition that 's carrying out airstrikes against isis
during the fight against the sunni extremist group , the coalition has found its interests aligned at times with those of iran , a shiite - majority nation that has strong ties with the iraqi government
iran - backed shiite militias played an important role in the recent battle to take the iraqi city of tikrit from isis jihadists
" iran has a long standing relationship with iraq , and as you point out , they have a very strong military presence there
they also have an influence over the shia militia who are operating within iraq , " she said
" so they are in iraq , in places that we are not
they also have a very sophisticated intelligence network and they have a lot of information that they 've been gathering
" bishop , who left tehran on sunday , declined to give details of the agreement with iran
" obviously , if iran has information that will be of interest to us , and if we have information that would be of interest to them , in pursuing our common purpose in defeating daesh , then that 's an appropriate exchange , " she said , using an alternative name for isis
but andrew wilkie , an independent australian member of parliament , criticized the plan
" the announcement by the foreign minister that australia is entering into a security arrangement with the regime in tehran really should send shudders down the spine of every australian , " he said , according to the australian broadcasting corporation
" when you start dancing with the devil in a place like tehran , then we run the risk of becoming almost as bad as those who we dance with , " wilkie told reporters .

australian foreign minister says deal is to focus on tracking citizens who join isis
but one lawmaker describes it as " dancing with the devil "
