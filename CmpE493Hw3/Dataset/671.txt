call it a little piece of heaven for a family torn apart by tragedy

sharry was eight months pregnant
but then smith fell and hit his head
he was taken to the ou medical center in oklahoma city
" july 13th 2014 was the absolute worst day of my life , " sharry posted on facebook
" i lost my best friend
the father of my unborn child
" their son taos arrived a few weeks later
when it was time for his 6 - month pictures , sharry had a special request
maybe the photographer could make their family complete , just for one picture " they asked me if i would be willing to ' play around ' with capturing their first family photo by editing taos ' daddy in one of their pictures , " kayli rene ' photography posted on facebook
" i just got to thinking , we do n't have a picture with smith in it , " the new mom told cnn affilaite koco
the photographer was n't sure it would work , but they found just the right picture of lane -- one that has him looking over his family 's shoulder
" smith 's not physically here with us , of course , but that picture represents to us that he is always watching over us and he will always be there for us no matter what , " sharry said
the family photo has become a social media sensation after appearing on the photographer 's facebook page this week
it has some 193,000 likes and more than 24,000 shares
" i ca n't believe she actually did this , " sharry said
" it 's like amazing and apparently everyone else thinks it is too

sierra sharry was eight months pregnant when her son 's father died
