it took prosecutors months to present 131 witnesses to support their claim that former nfl star aaron hernandez killed semi-pro player odin lloyd
on monday , hernandez 's defense gave its side of the story , wrapping up its witnesses in less than a day
hernandez , 25 , is on trial for the shooting death of lloyd , whose body was found in a massachusetts industrial park in june 2013
now that the defense has rested , it wo n't be long before the jury begins deliberating
much of the evidence in the former new england patriots ' case is circumstantial
here are some key points jurors will have to consider after each side makes closing arguments on tuesday : as news spread that hernandez was under investigation in june 2013 , patriots owner robert kraft called in the tight end for a meeting two days after lloyd 's death
" he said he was not involved , " kraft testified last week
" he said he was innocent , and that he hoped that the time of the murder incident came out because he said he was in a club
" there 's only one potential problem with that claim : the time lloyd was killed had n't been made public yet by the time hernandez met with kraft
so how could hernandez have known when lloyd was killed ? " what a great , great witness for the prosecution , " cnn legal analyst mel robbins said
" basically what happened is aaron hernandez lied to his boss
and the only way you rebut it is if you put him on the stand
" when questioned by a defense attorney , kraft said that he 'd never had any problems with hernandez and that the player was always respectful to him
hernandez 's fiancee , shayanna jenkins , revealed for the first time last week that hernandez told her to dispose of a box from the couple 's home that she said reeked of marijuana
she also said she did n't know what was in the box
that revelation may contradict the prosecution 's contention that the weapon used in the killing was in the box
the murder weapon in the case has not been recovered
during cross-examination by the defense , jenkins testified that she suspected marijuana because the box smelled " skunky
" earlier , she told prosecutors during direct examination that she did n't know what was in the box
she said hernandez never told her , and she never looked
after concealing the box with her daughter 's clothing , jenkins said she threw it away in " a random dumpster " but could not remember exactly where
much testimony has focused on the shoes hernandez wore the night lloyd was shot
a nike consultant testified that hernandez was wearing nike air jordan retro 11 lows
about 93,000 pairs of that shoe were made , significantly fewer in a size 13
the shoe 's sole makes a distinct impression , said lt. steven bennett of the massachusetts state police
the consultant testified under questioning from defense attorney jamie sultan that other nike shoes -- more than 3 million -- make the same impression
yet bennett , who works in crime scene services , testified that the footprint left near lloyd 's body was " in agreement " or consistent with the air jordan retro 11 lows size 13
although he did not have the shoes that hernandez wore that night , he used an identical pair to make his determination
bennett did so by creating a transparency of the sole and laying it over a photo of the footwear impression
jurors watched as he drew lines showing how the sole aligned with the impression
what may have been a key moment for the prosecution was quickly derailed by defense attorney jamie sultan
sultan questioned the science behind analyzing footprints
he introduced a march 2014 investigative report written by bennett saying the partial footwear impression lacked certain detail and quality to be able to make a comparison
prosecutors used grainy footage from hernandez 's home security system to suggest he was holding a .45 - caliber handgun -- the same kind of gun police said was used to kill lloyd
hernandez could be seen on camera pulling into his driveway minutes after lloyd was shot to death in an industrial park about a mile from hernandez 's home
" in my opinion , the firearm shown in the video stills is a glock pistol , " glock sales manager kyle aspinwall testified
the video is time - stamped minutes after workers in a nearby industrial park describe hearing loud noises like fireworks -- the moment prosecutors say lloyd was gunned down after getting out of a car hernandez was driving
hernandez 's lawyers then showed a different part of the video time - stamped a few seconds earlier with hernandez holding what appeared to be a shiny object in one hand , suggesting it may be an ipad
" glock pistols do n't have white glows to them , do they ? " defense attorney james sultan asked
" no , they do not , " aspinwall answered
sultan then displayed a soft - pellet gun similar in shape to a glock , suggesting it could also be the object hernandez is holding
hernandez has pleaded not guilty in lloyd 's death
but already , his arrest has led to deep consequences , including his release from the new england patriots and the loss of millions of dollars in expected earnings
so what might make a young man who had signed a $ 40 million contract risk everything ? prosecutors have said lloyd might have done or said something that did n't sit well with hernandez
they claimed hernandez rounded up some friends and orchestrated a hit to settle the score
hernandez 's co-defendants , ernest wallace and carlos ortiz , also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately
but the case gets more complicated
evidence collected in lloyd 's death investigation led to two more murder charges against hernandez in a separate case in boston
hernandez is also accused of shooting daniel de abreu and safiro furtado , allegedly over a spilled drink at a nightclub
that double shooting took place in july 2012 , almost a year before lloyd was killed
prosecutors have said in pretrial hearings that hernandez may have been mad at himself for possibly showing lloyd the spot where that double murder happened
during trial , prosecutors suggest a text written by hernandez the day before the murder saying he was " buggin " for showing lloyd " the spot " may have played a role in plotting to kill lloyd
the judge has banned any mention of the double murder in lloyd 's trial , ruling it is prejudicial
hernandez has pleaded not guilty in those deaths as well
but when the lloyd trial ends , that murder trial awaits him
cnn 's jason hanna , lawrence crook , laura dolan and catherine e. shoichet contributed to this report .
