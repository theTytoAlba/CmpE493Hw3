los angeles former rap mogul marion " suge " knight was ordered thursday to stand trial for murder and other charges stemming from a deadly hit - and - run confrontation on the movie set of the biopic " straight outta compton " earlier this year
in addition to that ruling , judge ronald coen also lowered knight 's bail to $ 10 million from $ 25 million , a figure that defense lawyers called excessive
the judge also dismissed one of the two counts of hit - and - run against knight
in all , knight will stand trial on one count of murder , one count of attempted murder and one count of hit - and - run , the judge ruled after holding a two - day preliminary hearing this week that ended thursday
knight , 49 , faces up to life in prison if convicted
knight suffers diabetes and blot clots , and the case has clearly strained him : he collapsed in court last month after learning of the $ 25 million bail and he was taken to the hospital for treatment
knight was in court thursday
at the end of hearing , he turned around and looked at his family in the gallery , and he smiled to his fiancee as deputies led him handcuffed out of the courtroom
in a press conference after the hearing , fiancee toi kelly said regarding knight 's health that he is " doing much better
" the judge dismissed the other hit - and - run count because california law says no more than one charge of hit - and - run should be brought against a defendant when the same weapon , in this case the vehicle knight was driving , is used against several people
knight is accused of running over two men , killing one of them , during an argument
killed was terry carter , 55
the survivor is cle sloan , 51 , who in testimony this week declined to identify knight as his attacker because sloan does n't want to be a " snitch " who sends knight to prison , according to cnn affiliates kabc and ktla
prosecutors offered sloan immunity , but he still refused to testify against knight on monday , the affiliates reported
the deadly incident happened on january 29 , after a flare - up on the set of the biopic " straight outta compton , " a film about the highly influential and controversial rap group n.w.a. the alleged argument spilled over to the parking lot of tam 's burgers in compton
at the time , knight was out on bail in a separate robbery case
the hit - and - run was captured on videotape and allegedly shows knight inside a red truck
in the video , the truck pulls into the entrance of the compton restaurant , and he is then approached by sloan , who was working security on the site
the two men appear to talk for a few moments , with knight still in his vehicle
suddenly , the vehicle backs up , knocking sloan to the ground
while still in reverse , the truck moves out of range of the security camera
the vehicle is then seen zooming forward , back into camera range , running over sloan a second time , and then running over a second man , carter , a former rap music label owner
in closing arguments prior to the judge 's ruling , knight 's attorney matthew fletcher argued that knight was the victim
knight was only defending himself against sloan , whom the defense attorney accused of possessing a gun at the time
" mr. sloan is the initial and consistent aggressor , " knight 's attorney argued
" there 's no intent to kill , there 's an intent to survive
" " even without a gun , we know mr. sloan was brave enough to attack in broad daylight , " the defense attorney said
fletcher added that knight 's defense was to stand his ground
sloan " needed immunity because he was the actual aggressor , " fletcher said
" he is the person who got carter ( carter ) killed
" los angeles county deputy district attorney cynthia barnes argued , however , told the judge that knight was engaged in " mutual combat situation " where he used his car as deadly weapon
if knight " ever had the right of self - defense , the moment he backed - up and mr. sloan was ran - over , he lost the right of self - defense , " barnes said
" there was pre-mediation and intent when he ( knight ) ran over him a second time
" knight is scheduled to be arraigned on april 30
the incident is the latest run - in with the law for knight , who founded the wildly successful death row records in 1991 and signed artists such as snoop doggy dogg ( now known as snoop lion ) and tupac shakur
knight was driving the car in which shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in las vegas in 1996
shortly afterward , knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions
that prison time -- along with shakur 's death , feuds between knight and a number of rappers , and desertions by dr. dre , snoop and others -- contributed to the label 's bankruptcy in 2006
in august , knight and two other people were shot while inside a celebrity - filled sunset strip party hosted by singer chris brown on the eve of the mtv video music awards .
