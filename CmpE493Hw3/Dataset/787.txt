a white police officer claims he feared for his life and is justified in killing an unarmed black man
a police chief supports the police officer , who is ultimately exonerated , and a predominantly black community seethes with rage because it knows that an injustice was done
we 've seen this movie before
spoiler alert : cop gets away with it
routine stops for walking in the middle of the street or driving with a broken taillight -- these should not result in anyone 's death
but time and again it ends with a black man dead in the street and the community has no recourse
this time the stage was set in north charleston , south carolina , a city of about 100,000 people
walter scott was stopped by officer michael slager for a broken taillight , and within minutes scott was dead
according to the incident report , slager said : " shots fired , and the subject is down
" his attorney at the time , david aylor , said that slager " felt threatened and reached for his department - issued firearm and fired his weapon
" but then came the video
we watched in horror as we saw slager shoot scott in the back multiple times
then we saw slager pick up something from one location and place it near scott 's lifeless body
on tuesday , the officer was arrested on murder charges
north charleston police chief eddie driggers told reporters , " i have watched the video , and i was sickened by what i saw
" apparently so was slager 's attorney , who announced after the video was made public that he was no longer representing the officer
after the video became public , the officials in north charleston deftly handled the situation
however , it was an easy case
there is no plausible evidence that slager feared for his life when scott is seen running away
in ferguson , the video we have in the death of michael brown is of press conferences with police chief tom jackson , who refused to release the police officer 's name , but did release a video that appeared to show michael brown stealing cigars
we have the video of the military weapons deployed by the police in ferguson that were trained on its residents and the press
north charleston 's police force is about 80 % white , with a population of 47 % black and 37 % white in the city
ferguson 's police force is 94 % white ( only three of the 53 police officers are black ) , and the city is 67 % black and 29 % white
both north charleston and ferguson have police forces that are not representative of the population they serve , yet because of a video north charleston 's police force got in front of the story
i 'm not sure north charleston gets here without learning something from the mistakes of ferguson
i have heard many commentators say the north charleston shooting does n't have anything to do with race
i do n't buy it
i wonder how many whites in north charleston with broken taillights get pulled over ? being pulled over for driving while black is a well - known phenomenon , which i discuss in my " critical race theory " casebook
racial profiling by slager could have been the catalyst for scott being pulled over in the first place
yes , the north charleston officials behaved differently than the officials in ferguson
i do n't think it 's because race had nothing to do with it
it is that perhaps the north charleston officials are better than those in ferguson when it comes to racially charged situations -- especially given the instructive fallout from brown 's shooting
and , of course , the video
it remains to be seen whether slager will be convicted of murder
strange things can happen in a jury room
recall how the rodney king videotape allowed a simi valley , california , jury to acquit the los angeles police officers , but a federal jury later convicted the officers of violating king 's civil rights
what a video proves can sometimes be in the eye of the beholder .

dorothy brown : shooting by cop might have followed usual narrative of blaming black suspects
but video in walter scott 's fatal shooting showed the truth , brown says
with hindsight from michael brown case , north charleston did the right thing with arrest
