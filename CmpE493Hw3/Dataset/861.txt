beautiful friend , the end
for the 1960s , the end arrived with -- depending on your ideals and your tribe -- either the rolling stones ' altamont fiasco in december 1969 , the kent state shootings in may 1970 or richard nixon 's 1972 re-election
for " mad men , " the " end of an era , " as its slogan has it , begins sunday
over the past eight years , the show about a 1960s advertising agency and its collision with changing times has become part of the national fabric , if never a huge ratings hit
stores have created fashion lines inspired by the show ; there have been " mad men " cocktails and " mad men " museum exhibits and even " mad men " presidential references
don draper , the creative director played by jon hamm , has become a symbol of the times -- his and , sometimes , ours
its subjects have taken the show to heart
in march , a " mad men " bench was unveiled in front of new york 's time & life building , where the fictional firm of sterling cooper & partners has its headquarters
the end of a tv series brings with it some risk
" the sopranos , " " mad men " creator matthew weiner 's former employer , divided fans with its famous cut - to - black finale
on the other hand , " mad men 's " former amc stablemate , " breaking bad , " was saluted for an almost perfect landing
speaking of landings : the last season -- technically , the first half of season 7 -- ended with the moon landing in july 1969
though weiner and his cast have been typically tight - lipped -- weiner even hid the finale from his cast at first -- it 's reasonable to assume the new season will pick up soon afterward
what 's going to happen ? here are some educated guesses
with the ' 60s screaming towards their conclusion , " mad men " probably wo n't jump ahead much
the latter half of 1969 included the manson murders , the woodstock festival , a new york mayoral campaign and the vietnam war moratorium demonstrations -- plenty of fodder for the characters to interact with , if only tangentially
who knows ? the show might even mention the miracle mets
it would be a nice way to acknowledge the agency 's late lane pryce
of course , weiner might have a different idea ; he 's from baltimore
" mad men " is generally a show about disintegration , reflective of the ' 60s themselves
the old orders are falling apart : white - shoe wasp firms like sterling cooper giving way to the ethnic pace - setters such as doyle dane bernbach ; grimy new york replaced by sunny los angeles ; the " good war " generation butting heads with the " make love , not war " cohort ; vacuum tubes and ledger books being displaced by a sleek , solid - state ibm world
it 's all an ad agency can do to keep up
last season saw plenty of intraoffice turmoil , thanks to the ill - fitting merger between sterling cooper and former rival cutler gleason and chaough
though the agency survived , it 's now without bert cooper ( robert morse ) and under the ownership of ( real - life ) madison avenue titan mccann erickson
that 's not a recipe for long - term survival , and expect a number of longtime characters -- ken cosgrove ( aaron staton ) , harry crane ( rich sommer ) and perhaps even joan harris ( christina hendricks ) -- to look for an exit
roger sterling -- the wisecracking executive played by john slattery -- might find an exit as well , but not one he 's anticipating
he 's suffered two heart attacks
he 's never grown up
bet on a sudden and shocking departure
on the other hand , peggy olson 's star has continued to rise ( much like one of the character 's models , advertising wunderkind mary wells lawrence )
she left sterling cooper once ; indeed , she would n't have returned if her new agency had n't merged with her old one
if olson , played by elisabeth moss , bolts the firm , it will probably be to head her own agency -- and possibly get married
that is , if she 's still interested in such an old - fashioned tradition
in recent seasons , don 's ex-wife , betty ( january jones ) , has lost herself amid all the turmoil
she sees herself through the eyes of her spouses , and though husband henry francis ( christopher stanley ) has been far more supportive than don , he 's a busy man
and sally , don 's daughter ( kiernan shipka ) , is proving to be a handful
on the one hand , she 's obviously bright ; on the other , she 's a teenager and starting to rebel
in recent seasons she 's run away and started sneaking cigarettes , and she 's always fighting with her mother
you could see her hitchhiking to woodstock , or at least dropping out of school
anything 's possible , but given all that the character has been through -- divorces , affairs , office politics , morose late - night rides with glen bishop -- it 's a bit on the nose , is n't it ? instead , try this : it 's april 1 , 1970
richard nixon is signing legislation banning cigarette ads on radio and television , reminding don of the day 10 years earlier when he came up with the lucky strike campaign that began the series
no fool , he had seen this day coming years before
he 'll fix himself a drink , ponder buying an avocado - colored refrigerator , clean out his ashtray and leave the show the way he arrived : on top of the zeitgeist , unable to accept his past and utterly , inscrutably alone .

" mad men 's " final seven episodes begin airing april 5
the show has never had high ratings but is considered one of the great tv series
it 's unknown what will happen to characters , but we can always guess
