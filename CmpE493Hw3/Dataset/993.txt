" success kid " is likely the internet 's most famous baby
you 've seen him in dozens of memes , fist clenched in a determined look of persevering despite the odds
success kid -- now an 8 - year - old named sammy griner -- needs a little bit of that mojo to rub off on his family
his dad , justin , needs a kidney transplant
about a week ago , laney griner , justin 's wife and sammy 's mother , created a gofundme campaign with a goal of $ 75,000 to help cover the medical expenses that go along with a kidney transplant
the campaign is already a success
by wednesday it had topped its goal
griner told the daily dot that her husband was diagnosed with kidney disease in 2006 and suffered complete kidney failure three years later
" one can only survive with no natural kidney function ... for so long , " laney griner said
" his energy and mood are affected ; he can no longer work , and he spends 12 hours a week in dialysis clinic
" having been on dialysis for this long greatly increases his risks of developing further complications
the only way to save his life is to get a transplant
there 's no other way around that , " she said
the family does n't know when a kidney might become available
their gofundme page has a link for potential donors
sammy 's internet fame began in 2007 when his mom posted a picture of him on a beach with a fist full of sand and a satisfied look on his face
myspace picked it up , so did reddit
the rest is internet history
success just seems to run in some families .
