it 's a hard - knock life , jay z , especially on twitter
the uber private rapper / entrepreneur broke out of his usually reserved social media shell over the weekend to defend the performance of his new music streaming service , tidal
using the hashtag # tidalfacts , he attempted to refute talk that the company has been doing a less than stellar job in taking on competitor spotify
he launched the subscription - based music service last month with a star - studded news conference in which artists such as madonna , kanye west , daft punk and jay z 's wife , beyonce , came together in support of what singer alicia keys told the crowd was " the first ever artist - owned global music and entertainment platform
" cnn money : jay z 's tidal music service to be owned by artists but less than a month after its debut , there 's been chatter that the service is underwhelming , and jay z 's " stream of consciousness " tweets denying that were met with some derision
and , of course , a tidal facts parody twitter account was quickly created to offer some " facts " of its own .

the rapper / entrepreneur went " stream of consciousness " on twitter
he asked users to be patient with tidal , his new music streaming service
a parody account was set up to mock his hashtag
