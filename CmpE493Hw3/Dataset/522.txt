are you smarter than a really smart singapore high school student ? see if you can figure out cheryl 's birthday , the singapore logic problem that 's got the internet twisted into knots
some are even saying it 's the math equivalent of the " what color is the dress " debate
the puzzling problem went viral after singapore television host kenneth kong posted it to facebook
cheryl 's birthday challenge was meant to test the better high - school students competing in the singapore and asian schools math olympiad , held april 8
here it is : cheryl has a birthday , and she does n't want to share it right away
( otherwise , we have no challenge to solve
) so she gives her friends albert and bernard a list of 10 possible birthday dates : may 15 , may 16 , may 19 , june 17 , june 18 , july 14 , july 16 , august 14 , august 15 or august 17
a brief conversation between albert and bernard -- who we assume are not lying for the sake of this problem -- gives the reader enough clues to eliminate nine of the 10 dates and discover cheryl 's birthday
that 's assuming you want to celebrate with cheryl after she 's put you through all that trouble
see our video below for the answer from georgia tech mathematician matt baker
the new york times and the washington post have also posted solutions to the problem , along with explanations
of course , the internet has offered other solutions .
