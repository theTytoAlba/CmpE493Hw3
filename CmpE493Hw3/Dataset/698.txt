i remember the day i stopped praying
it was the day after my little brother , jimmy , died of cancer
i was so angry at god
i was 27 at the time , and , like most young people i had stopped going to church
but , on that day -- that terrible day -- i desperately needed to understand why god took my brother
i called the nearest catholic church , looking for a priest
a lady picked up the phone
" can i talk with father ? " i asked
i wish i could say her answer was " yes
" instead , she asked me if i was a member of that particular parish
" does it matter ? " i asked
( at the time i lived far from my home parish
) i do n't remember how she responded , but the answer about my being able to see father was clearly no. i do n't know if all catholic churches would have shut me out , but i figured , at the time , it was part of the long list of rules the vatican required catholic leaders to follow
i cried for a bit , then decided i would never ask god for anything
clearly , his conduits on earth did not have time for me -- a lifelong catholic -- and sinner -- so why would he ? ever since , i 've considered myself a lapsed catholic
there is something about pope francis that 's reawakened my faith
and it 's not because he opened the floodgates to allow sin in the eyes of the church
he still argues against things i passionately support , but i find myself -- like many other lapsed catholics -- enthralled
recently i had the pleasure of meeting one of the francis 's newly appointed cardinals
his name is cardinal gerald lacroix
the 57 - year - old presides at the basilica cathedral of notre dame in quebec city
one of my first questions : what is it about pope ? " every person is a mystery you know
... but what 's evident is this man is living with such freedom , such inner freedom
he 's in tune with the lord , " lacroix told me
" those close to him say he 's up close to 4 in the morning to prepare his daily mass , which is at 7 in the morning on the weekdays
so that 's almost three hours of prayer , preparation and silence before the lord and the word of god
wow , that really fine - tunes you to start off a day
" perhaps that 's how the pope francis stays humble
why he defies tradition and washes the feet of the disabled , women and those of other faiths
why he ordered showers to be built for the poor in st. peter 's square
all of this is appealing , but it 's more than that
in my mind , it 's his tone
when pope pope said , " if a person is gay and he searches for the lord and has good will , who am i to judge ? " the comment took me aback
homosexuality has long been a taboo subject for the vatican , yet pope francis uttered those welcoming words
lacroix likened the francis 's approach to jesus
" jesus did n't judge
jesus did not come as a judge
he came as someone who preached and talked about the love of god
" those kinds of answers are so different in my experience , but i understand why more conservative catholics worry
if the pope does not judge , then who will tell us who is a sinner and who is not ? " i hear that sometimes , too , " lacroix told me
" i think pope is conservative in the right way
you have to be conservative enough to come back to what is the foundation : that 's the gospel
you can not reproach pope francis of not living the gospel , or not preaching the truth of the gospel
" but is n't homosexuality a sin in the eyes of the church ? " there is room for everyone
the door is open , " cardinal lacroix insisted
" of course you know that the catholic church will never promote same sex marriage , but do we respect homosexual persons ? do we welcome them ? do we accompany them ? of course
but to respect the church and its teaching , which is based on a long tradition and also the word of god , we will not go so far as to bless
but that does n't mean we reject
" that last sentiment -- " that does n't mean we reject
" -- did it for me
i finally understood why pope francis reawakened my faith
i always felt my church would reject me for committing the smallest of sins
like calling a priest at a church that was not my home parish
like not covering my head with a traditional veil at easter
like accidentally eating meat on holy friday
like supporting the use of contraception
but as lacroix told me , jesus walked with sinners until the very end
he did not banish them to fires of hell , for he refused to give up on anyone
the cardinal 's last words to me : " i 'm trying to do my best on ( the ) local level -- to have an open ear to what the church and world are experiencing
to see how we can today respond to those needs
i want people to see me , and the church , as an open heart to grow together
not a church that 's imposing -- we have nothing to impose -- we have someone to propose : the lord jesus and his gospel
" i ca n't wait to go church next sunday
and , yes , i will bow my head and pray for forgiveness , and if i 'm worthy , christ 's love .

there is something about pope francis that 's reawakened her faith , say cnn 's carol costello
meeting cardinal gerald lacroix of quebec showed how the pope francis is putting people in place to carry out his new vision , costello writes
