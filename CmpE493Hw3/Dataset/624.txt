a photo of a baby boy being pulled from the rubble of the nepal earthquake has become the defining image of a disaster that has devastated the country
his tiny face is coated in dust from the debris that crashed around him as the earth shook on saturday , april 25 , killing more than 5,000 people and injuring at least twice as many more
his name is sonit awal , and he 's just four months old
on saturday , sonit was at home in muldhoka , bhaktapur , east of the capital kathmandu , when the 7.8 - magnitude quake sent tremors through nepal and neighboring countries , according to kathmandu today
the house collapsed , burying the child , leaving his father shyam awal frantically searching for him amid the rubble
a desperate awal called the nepalese army , and they too scrambled through the dirt and debris until midnight , before giving up hope and leaving
sonit 's father had lost all hope of finding his son alive , the paper reported , until he heard faint cries from below
on sunday morning , the soldiers returned and at 10 a.m they lifted sonit clear of the fallen rocks , beams , bricks and dust that had trapped him for 22 hours
his rescuers held him high in their hands to the sun , though his eyes were still wedged tightly shut
sonit 's face was exposed during the whole ordeal , though a hooded top and shawl protected his head and body during the cold night spent under rubble
the baby was taken to bhaktapur hospital and found to be uninjured ; his unlikely rescue provides some hope to a country that has experienced so much loss .
