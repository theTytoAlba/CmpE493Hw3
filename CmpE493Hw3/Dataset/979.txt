australian prime minister tony abbott has been caught on camera guzzling a glass of beer in seven seconds amid raucous cheers from onlookers
his feat of swift consumption in a crowded bar impressed some people but annoyed others
and observers were quick to point out that abbott had previously criticized binge drinking in australia
abbott was in a sydney pub on saturday evening when a group of australian rules football players invited him to have a drink with them
the prime minister accepted and even gave a short , impromptu speech , one of the football coaches , simon carrodus , told the australian woman 's weekly
" then he proceeds to reach down and grab a schooner and he drank from head - to - toe the entire schooner , dribbling little bits on his shirt ... tipped it upside down on his head
and he was proud as punch , " carrodus said
a schooner holds about three - quarters of a pint
video of abbott making short work of the beer as the crowd around him chants " skol ! skol ! " drew plenty of attention on social media
some commentators focused on abbott 's drinking technique
but others suggested he was setting a bad example
abbott had attacked binge drinking as recently as last year
" like most australians , i enjoy a drink on social occasions , " he said in january 2014
" however , as a father and as a citizen , i 'm appalled by the violent binge drinking culture that now seems so prevalent , especially at " hot spots " in our big cities
" casting those concerns aside , some social media users belittled abbott 's beer swilling
they said his effort was a pale imitation of the legendary drinking exploits of former prime minister bob hawke , who is credited with drinking two and a half pints in 11 seconds .

some observers applaud abbott 's beer swilling in a pub full of sportsmen
the prime minister last year criticized binge drinking culture in australia
