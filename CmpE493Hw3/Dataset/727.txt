tokyo a crowd gathers near the entrance of tokyo 's upscale mitsukoshi department store , which traces its roots to a kimono shop in the late 17th century
fitting with the store 's history , the new greeter wears a traditional japanese kimono while delivering information to the growing crowd , whose expressions vary from amusement to bewilderment
it 's hard to imagine the store 's founders in the late 1600 's could have imagined this kind of employee
that 's because the greeter is not a human -- it 's a robot
aiko chihira is an android manufactured by toshiba , designed to look and move like a real person
it was put on temporary display at the department store
toshiba says chihira has 43 motors allowing it to move , speak in sign language and even sing
the regular greeter , ayako seiryu , says she 's not worried about a robot replacing her -- even one made to resemble a real 32 - year - old woman
" communication is important , " she says
" my strength is i can actually talk to people
" chihira ca n't have a conversation yet , acknowledges hitoshi tokuda , toshiba spokesperson
but he says the technology is evolving quickly and someday , robots like chihira could replace humans for certain jobs
a growing number of japanese businesses are testing out robots as a possible solution to the country 's shrinking workforce
they 're appearing in stores , banks and soon even hotels
bank of tokyo - mitsubishi ufj is trying out " nao , " a customer service robot that answers basic questions and is designed to speak 19 languages
the robotic polygot could prove useful serving foreign customers during the 2020 tokyo olympics
by then , the bank hopes to have even more robots on staff
" pepper " is a humanoid robot that " chats " with customers
a humanoid has human - like characteristics such as arms , legs and a head -- but is designed to look like a robot
pepper first began appearing in tokyo stores last year
manufacturer softbank hopes it 'll eventually be a " family robot , " like a sleeker version of rosie on " the jetsons
" meet pepper -- the world 's first emo robot a hotel scheduled to open at huis ten bosch theme park in nagasaki this summer plans to have 10 robot staff members and aims to increase that to more than 90 % of hotel services operated by robots
today 's novelty could be tomorrow 's necessity
japan has an aging population that has prompted serious talks about how to incorporate robots into the nation 's shrinking workforce
one group that seems willing to embrace robots are japan 's senior citizens
a survey by nursing home operator orix living found more seniors would feel comfortable being cared for by a robot than a foreign nurse
in a nation with a dwindling population , waning workforce , and deep resistance to immigration , it seems robots will only play a larger role in japan 's future .
