a federal grand jury has charged millionaire real estate heir robert durst , a convicted felon , with unlawful possession of a firearm
in this week 's indictment , durst , 71 , is accused of possessing a .38 caliber revolver , which authorities allegedly found in his hotel room last month
he faces a maximum of 10 years in prison if found guilty of that charge , according to the indictment
the charge is the latest in a litany of accusations
a louisiana judge ruled last month that durst , who is charged with first - degree murder , will be held without bail at a facility near new orleans
durst was featured this spring in " the jinx , " a hbo documentary about him
he 's accused of killing his friend susan berman at her home in california in 2000
he also faces state weapons and drugs charges in new orleans
last month , court documents claimed that durst had a loaded .38 - caliber revolver , marijuana , his passport and birth certificate , a latex mask with salt - and - pepper hair attached and more than $ 40,000 cash
he also had a ups tracking number
the package was intercepted by the fbi , prosecutors said , and it contained clothing and more than $ 100,000 in cash
but the bigger courtroom fight will probably unfold in los angeles , where the district attorney filed a first - degree murder charge against durst last month
he awaits extradition to los angeles to face that charge
if convicted , he could face the death penalty
prosecutors accuse durst of " lying in wait " and killing berman , a crime writer and his longtime confidante , because she " was a witness to a crime
" berman was shot in the head in her beverly hills home in december 2000 , shortly before investigators were set to speak with her about the 1982 disappearance of durst 's first wife , kathleen mccormack durst
durst has long maintained that he had nothing to do with berman 's death or his wife 's disappearance
it 's not the first time he has been accused of murder
he admitted killing and dismembering his neighbor at a 2003 trial , but he was acquitted after arguing that he acted in self - defense
fbi agents have also asked local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where durst lived over the past five decades , a u.s. law enforcement official said
unsolved cases in vermont , upstate new york , the san francisco bay area and southern california are among those getting a new look , the official said
durst 's attorney , dick deguerin , said it 's a sign that authorities are desperate
deguerin has said durst has serious medical conditions
he is suffering from hydrocephalus , which required brain surgery a couple of years ago , deguerin said
doctors implanted a stent on the right side of his head , the attorney said
" at the same time he was in the hospital , he had an operation on his esophagus to remove cancer
so he 's got some serious health issues
... he 's lost a lot of weight
he 's not in good health , " deguerin said
deguerin also said that durst is " mildly autistic " and has received treatment in the past from one of the country 's leading experts in asperger 's syndrome and autism .
