according to paris prosecutor 's spokeswoman agnes thibault - lecuivre , the lawsuit was filed march 27 and a preliminary investigation was opened by the prosecutor 's office wednesday
the media outlet , cnn affiliate bfmtv , is accused of endangering the lives of the hostages , who were hiding in a cold room during the attack , by broadcasting their location live during the siege
bfm in a statement friday said one of its journalists " mentioned only once the presence of a woman hidden inside the hyper cacher , on the basis of police sources on the ground
" " immediately , the chief editor felt that this information should not be released
it therefore has subsequently never been repeated on air or posted on - screen
bfmtv regrets that the mention of this information could cause concern to the hostages , as well as their relatives , that their lives were in danger , " the statement said
gunman amedy coulibaly , also suspected in the slaying of a police officer , stormed the hyper cacher jewish supermarket on january 9 , killing four people and taking others hostage
he was killed in the police operation to end the siege
a 24 - year - old supermarket employee , malian - born lassana bathily , was hailed as a hero afterward when it emerged that he had risked his life to hide 15 customers from coulibaly in the cold room
the hostage - taking was the culmination of three days of terror in paris that began with the january 7 shooting of 12 people at the offices of french satirical magazine charlie hebdo
the two brothers blamed for that attack , cherif and said kouachi , were killed on january 9 after a violent standoff at an industrial site
