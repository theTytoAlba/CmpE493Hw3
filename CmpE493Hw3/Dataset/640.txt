it 's the simplest possible assignment , but it always teaches a huge lesson
every year , denver teacher kyle schwartz passes out post-it notes to her third grade students and asks them to complete the sentence , " i wish my teacher knew ... " many of the students she teaches at doull elementary just wish they had something in common with her , that she knew soccer or video games
but sometimes , their wishes bring tears to her eyes , and offer a glimpse of painful struggles in their young lives
there 's a student who misses her father : " i have n't seen him in six years
" another who wants to tell her she 's lonely : " i do n't have friend to play with me
" still another who wants to explain why her reading log goes unsigned : " my mom is not around a lot
" and other who has big hopes for the future : " i want to go to college
" the assignment sprang from the kinds of conversations teachers have all the time , schwartz said : " what do our students need ? how can we best serve them ? " schwartz always gives her students the option to write their names on their notes or remain anonymous ; of sharing them only with her , or with the entire class
it surprises her how often students stand up and want to read their wishes out loud , like the shy student who shared , " i wish my teacher knew i 'm nervous all the time
" " they feel respected , they feel safe enough to share some of these more sensitive ones , " said schwartz , who has been teaching for three years
" kids can share what they feel comfortable with
" recently , schwartz began to post some students ' responses on twitter using the hashtag # iwishmyteacherknew
it spread , as teachers around the country tried it with their own classrooms
they sometimes reveal what kids are most worried about right now , like the child whose mother was sick , or another who had just experienced bullying
one student just wants more attention from the teacher
sometimes , they have a little fun : " i wish my teacher knew how to do a backflip
" occasionally , students want to reassure their teachers that that they 're doing a great job
there 's a lot for teachers to learn , too : " they are kids who deal with a lot as they grow up , " one educator posted on twitter
schwartz said she 's learned not to assume what her students wish
although most of the students at her school live in poverty , not every message is about a material need
there 's no pressure to share something they 're not ready to talk about , she said , and " they 're acutely aware of their own needs
" through assignments like this , she is , too
as her idea spread , many twitter users asked how they can help to support her students
she 's pointed them toward a donorschoose.org fund where she posts a classroom project wish list
so far , most have been fulfilled .
