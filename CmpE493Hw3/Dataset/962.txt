we did it again , in another american city
we set baltimore on fire this time
we turned a funeral into a riot
we let things get out of hand
we threw stones at policemen
we threw stones at citizens
we created camera - ready chaos , and we replayed the images
we created a culture of such deep distrust and disrespect that violence seemed the inevitable response
we let the violence flow
we let the violence stand for everything that 's wrong with the things we already did n't like
by now you may be asking , " who 's we ? " you may be saying with some irritation , " do n't lump me in with them
i did n't have anything to do with it
" to which the only real answer can be : stop kidding yourself
the word " we " is one of the great american words
i use " we " a lot when i talk about our country 's achievements
i like to say we won the second world war , we put a man on the moon , we invented the internet , we gave the world jazz
well , if i -- a son of immigrants whose family had nothing to do with any of those accomplishments -- if i get to claim those aspects of american history , then surely i have to claim the unsavory aspects too
" we " cuts both ways
we cut reconstruction short and made a mockery of equal citizenship
we supported jim crow , then redlined , subordinated , and ghettoized african - americans
we cut blacks out of the new deal
we created a polity in which racial inequity and economic inequality magnify each other unrelentingly
we tried to put a lid on it with heavy policing and a war on drugs
we are the authors of every page of baltimore 's story
do n't tell me it 's not your responsibility or mine
about how slavery and its legacy are artifacts of a time past
no , we own them all
and we all have to face that before we can fix anything in baltimore or beyond
but there 's another dimension of the story of " we " that matters as well
it 's about progressives and conservatives and their competing stories of how we got here
every time protests and violence break out in response to police brutality , the same depressing pattern breaks out
the event becomes simply a rorschach test for left and right , and each side sees in the rioting confirmation of its prior views
for the left , it 's about the deep structural root causes of the alienation and violence
liberals gravitate on social media to commentaries or reactions that reinforce this frame , like the surprisingly astute comments from the baltimore orioles executive who spelled out why a long history of racial injustice and economic disenfranchisement made rioting nearly inevitable
conservatives gravitate to their own frames , about a lack of personal responsibility or role models among poor urban blacks , about the failures of great society and democratic programs , and about how it all comes back to a president ( who happens to be black ) who has divided us by focusing so much on race
what gets lost in this groundhog day replay of left - right frames is a simple reality that we all have to recognize : both longstanding structural racism and personal irresponsibility are on display this week
both a history of police brutality and a present crisis of street violence
both an inherited , multigenerational lack of opportunity and a dearth of leaders willing to address it
we can not separate out the aspects of the problem that do n't fit our preferred explanation -- not if we are sincere about solving the problem
and until more people can see this , we will not see progress
we ca n't judge looters for their antisocial behavior without judging a color - caste structure and a school - to - prison pipeline that has flushed them away like so much refuse
by the same token , we ca n't keep opining about root causes without also supporting the parents and pastors and neighbors who , in their own small ways , are organizing each other to break the cycle of brokenness
i 'm of the left
but it can not possibly be that only those with whom i disagree are responsible for what is happening in baltimore
it can not possibly be that only my worldview contains all the solutions
whatever our political perspective , we need to open our eyes to what is actually happening in baltimore and other cities in the united states in the second decade of the 21st century
we should all be able to say that
it 's time to push each other out of our ideological and identity comfort zones and build unlikely coalitions to create more opportunity
it 's time to act like we are all in charge
and there is no other " we " waiting in the wings .

in baltimore , after the death of freddie gray , riots erupted , cars were set on fire and 200 arrests were made
eric liu : liberals and conservatives react predictably , see the riots as confirmation of their views
it 's time to push each other out of our ideological and identity comfort zones and change the status quo , he says
