tokyo a japanese court has issued a landmark injunction halting plans to restart two nuclear reactors in the west of the country , citing safety concerns , a court official told cnn
japan 's nuclear watchdog , the nuclear regulation authority , had previously given a green light to the reopening of reactors 3 and 4 of the kansai electric power company 's takahama nuclear plant
but locals successfully petitioned the court in fukui prefecture , where the plant is located , raising concerns about whether the reactors would survive a strong earthquake
japan 's 48 nuclear reactors are offline in the wake of the fukushima disaster in 2011 , when a tsunami triggered by a massive earthquake sent a wall of water crashing into the power plant
since then , the island nation has imported greater amounts of expensive natural gas and coal to meet its energy needs
japanese prime minister shinzo abe has pushed for a return to nuclear energy , arguing it is essential to the country 's economic recovery to reduce the skyrocketing utility bills associated with energy imports
but opinion polls have consistently shown public opposition to a nuclear restart
keith henry , managing director of tokyo - based asia strategy , which advises businesses on japanese public policy issues , says the decision will force abe to rethink the economics of his energy policy
" that was a body blow [ for abe ] because it 's no longer a political issue , it 's a legal issue
it changes the calculus and the dynamics , " he said
" it 's now in the courts
and the government is powerless to do anything about it

the nuclear plant operator had argued in court that the plant was safe , meeting heightened safety regulations introduced by the nuclear watchdog following the fukushima disaster
it said in a statement that " scientific and professional findings " showed that the safety of the reactors was assured
but the court ruled that the new safety standards were " loose , " lacked rationality and could not guarantee the safety of the plant , an official said
the power company said it would appeal the decision
" we deeply regret that our assertion was not well comprehended , and can not accept it at all , " it said in a statement
chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga told reporters tuesday that the country 's nuclear watchdog had deemed the plant safe according to the " world 's strictest " safety standards
the government had no intention to change course on its planned nuclear restart , he said
takahama was one of two nuclear facilities granted approval to resume operations
sendai nuclear power plant in kagoshima prefecture has been granted approval to reopen by the prefecture 's governor , although local residents are seeking to challenge this in court
analyst henry said the renewable energy sector could benefit from the takahama decision , as the country weighed solar and hydro power as alternatives
prior to the fukushima disaster , about 30 % of japan 's energy was nuclear generated
