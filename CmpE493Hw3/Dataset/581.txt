saudi arabia had launched airstrikes on houthi positions across yemen , hoping to wipe out the iranian - allied rebel group that has overthrown the government and seized power
the saudis say they want to restore the yemeni government , a key u.s. ally in the fight against al qaeda , which was kicked out of the capital by the rebels earlier this year
this month , saudi officials said airstrikes have degraded houthi - controlled military infrastructure , including key buildings in the capital sanaa

ground troops will continue to protect the border and confront any attempts to destabilize the situation , asiri said
military action will be taken if needed
but beyond the military campaign , the saudis and their allies have said they want to find a political solution for the violence - plagued nation
the aim is to bring back yemen 's " security and stability through establishing a political process , " said a statement from saudi arabia , the united arab emirates , bahrain , qatar and kuwait
ousted yemen president abdu rabu mansour hadi thanked the saudi - led coalition
hadi claims he 's yemen 's legitimate leader and is working with the saudis and other allies to return to his country
" we promise to restructure the yemen military to ensure that it serves the people of yemen , " hadi said , calling on the houthis to withdraw , and saying that he would return to yemen at " the right time " to rebuild the country
" you will witness many changes in the days to come in our mission to build an institutional government and military , far from rebel militancy , " said hadi
also tuesday , a u.s. military official told cnn that the united states is conducting " manned reconnaissance " off yemen
the official stressed that the repositioning of u.s. ships over the last days was not done to interdict iranian ships , but to ensure freedom of navigation and maritime security
