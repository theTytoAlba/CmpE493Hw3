the accidental death of a 2 - year - old boy in milwaukee on sunday triggered a violent chain of events , eventually claiming the lives of three more people
it all started with a birthday party that little damani terry was attending
during the family gathering , he dashed out into the street and was struck and killed by a gmc van , according to milwaukee police
the distraught driver , archie brown jr. , 40 , immediately stopped and got out to tend to the boy
but it was too late , police said
damani 's alarmed family came running , including his older brother , 15 - year - old rasheed chiles , police said
that was not the end of the situation
soon , two more people would also die : the driver and the teen were both felled by bullets fired by the same man , police said
that man , identified as ricky ricardo chiles iii , was located late wednesday at a chicago - area hotel
he committed suicide as authorities closed in with a warrant for his arrest , milwaukee police chief ed flynn told reporters
" chicago police and united states marshals service entered the hotel room , whereupon mr. chiles took his own life with his firearm , " the police chief said thursday
