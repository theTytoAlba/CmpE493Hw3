somewhere over the rainbow , people on the internet are losing their minds
is it real ? after the new york area received a large amount of rain , four rainbows stretched across the early morning sky on tuesday
amanda curtis , ceo of a fashion company in new york , snapped the lucky shot
at first , she thought it was just one
" but i looked a little bit closer and saw that there were actually four , " she told cnn
" i had a small moment of awe
" she posted the picture to twitter , and within a few hours , it had already received hundreds of retweets
" it 's been surreal i feel like we 're breaking the internet but in a really great way , " she told cnn affiliate wpix
according to cnn weather producer rachel aissen , this would be a double rainbow that has been reflected in the sky , due to a smooth body of water underneath the rainbow
this is n't the first time rainbows have shown up in multiples
but the splendor of such a scene can render us speechless , even emotional -- much like the star of the famous " double rainbow " video
cnn ireporter yosemitebear vasquez posted a video to youtube in 2010 reacting to a double rainbow he spotted in yosemite national park
the video has since garnered over 40 million views
of course , we asked the unofficial rainbow spokesman to weigh in on the phenomenon
" whoa , that 's a quadruple rainbow ! all the way , " he exclaims
" what does it mean ? " we do n't know exactly , but the internet ca n't get enough .
