comedian chris rock made light of racial disparities in police treatment of whites and blacks with a tongue - in - cheek guide to not being beaten by the police
he encapsulated the frustration and grief caused by a new york grand jury 's decision not to indict a white police officer in the death of a black man with a simple tweet : " this one was on film
" now , he 's stirring things up again with a series of tweets documenting three traffic stops in seven weeks
" stopped by the cops again wish me luck , " he posted early tuesday , along with a photo showing him behind the wheel of a car with what looks like blue police lights in the background
he posted similar photos in february
many african - americans have long bemoaned the phenomenon of being pulled over for no apparent reason , calling it " driving while black
" blacks are about 30 % more likely to be pulled over by police than whites , according to figures reported by the bureau of justice statistics in 2013
and in amid increased conversation over race and policing after the high - profile deaths last year of eric garner in new york and michael brown in ferguson , missouri , the issue is even more sensitive
rock has n't commented on the tweets and did n't say how the police stop turned out
he got lots of support on twitter
" my heart legit dropped , no kidding , " one twitter fan posted
many praised him for documenting the stops
some accused him of race - baiting
but one bit of advice in particular lit up social media
actor isaiah washington urged rock to " # adapt " to avoid racial profiling
" i sold my $ 90,000.00 mercedes g500 and bought 3 prius 's , because i got tired of being pulled over by police , " washington tweeted
some saw that as a sell - out , saying rock should n't have to take steps others might not have to as a way to avoid being pulled over
. you also make sure your pants are pulled up as well ?
" twitter user yeshacallahan posted
appearing on cnn , washington defended the tweet , saying he wanted to " excite a conversation
" years ago , rock filmed a sketch for his " chris rock " show on hbo in which he detailed ways to avoid being beaten by police as a black man
besides obeying the law , he suggested bringing a white friend along for the ride
he did just that last year in a segment of " comedians in cars getting coffee " with jerry seinfeld
the two chat as seinfeld drives an orange lamborghini
and what happened ? they get pulled over after seinfeld goes a bit heavy on the gas
" here 's the crazy thing , " rock tells seinfeld as the police officer stops the duo
" if you were n't here , i 'd be scared

chris rock posts selfies after being pulled over three times in last seven weeks
" stopped by the cops again wish me luck , " he posted this week
