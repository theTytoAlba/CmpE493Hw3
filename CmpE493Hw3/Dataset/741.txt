editor 's note : ines dumig was recently announced as a center grant recipient
sahra , a somali refugee , left her home at 14 years old
throughout her journey in search of asylum , she managed to overcome dangers and discomforts
but she never gave up , and she continuously reminded herself to keep going
she 's the focus of ines dumig 's photo series " apart together
" dumig met sahra through a photo workshop at refugio , a shelter in munich , germany , for refugees and torture victims
what drew dumig to sahra specifically was her strength and her ability to effectively reflect on all of her experiences
" it really impressed me how she deals with everything , " dumig said
" she 's strong in her way of connecting with the culture here and also reflecting on what happened , the culture where she comes from
" the number of refugees seeking asylum in the european union increased by 25 % last year , with germany receiving the most applications
one of the reasons dumig decided to photograph sahra is because growing up in germany made dumig realize that she lived a fortunate lifestyle
another reason has to do with dumig 's interest in people 's emotions and finding one 's identity
" i realized so many people want to come to europe , and i always had the feeling to disappear or to go away , " dumig said
" seeing how people live in other parts of the world made me realize how privileged i am
" " apart together " serves not only as a documentation of sahra , but as a far - reaching story about people from all backgrounds
the title of dumig 's work refers to the fact that although people may be physically apart from one another , the comparable feelings they experience are what link all people together
" sometimes we feel strong , sometimes we feel lost -- that 's kind of universal , i think , " dumig said
" that 's why i want to universalize ( sahra 's ) story as well , not only make it about her
" the underlying themes of " apart together " include the feelings of isolation and " otherness " and the search for a valuable human dignity

" every one of these ( refugees ) have strong stories , and in the bureaucratic system , they are just a number or a document , " dumig said
" but they are a person , they are people with emotions and lives
" sahra is currently under the status of " suspension of deportation , " meaning german immigration officials may grant her discretionary relief from deportation
dumig describes sahra as someone living through an unresolved situation
regardless of the challenges sahra faces as a refugee in germany , she is a survivor and the embodiment of resilience , determined to establish a new life for herself
she has learned to speak german fluently , and she has started working in the nation as well
like an unsolved photographic puzzle , each photo within " apart together " provides a piece of insight into sahra 's experiences
there is no certain and clear way in which to arrange the pieces , because they are a representation of the fragmented nature of sahra 's life
many of dumig 's photos are not of sahra herself , but instead show her surroundings
this makes " apart together " rich in symbolism and challenges viewers to develop their own perceptions
the photos are powerful because of this symbolic nature , as there are infinite interpretations attached to each one
" i think everyone interprets by themselves , by however way they perceive it through their own experience
that 's up to the viewer , " dumig said
" it depends on who looks at the pictures
... everyone will see something different
" " apart together " allowed dumig to share various special moments with sahra , and they were both able to learn from each other
" it was just something we both got something out of , " dumig said
