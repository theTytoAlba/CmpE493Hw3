jackson gordon is no ordinary 21 - year - old
by day he is an industrial design student at philadelphia university , but gordon has another side to him -- a side altogether darker , tougher and more enigmatic
hanging in his workshop gordon has a full suit of armor plating , cape and cowl -- matte black and built to stop a knife
gordon has an alter ego : the dark knight himself , batman
you might expect his origin story to be cloaked in mystery , but speaking to cnn gordon is quick to explain how the transformation took place
gordon says his calling came five years ago when he began experimenting with cosplay
" previously i 'd been involved with costume making ... i 'd made a version of the batsuit from christopher nolan 's ' dark knight trilogy ' and i really liked that suit , " gordon says
but , as elaborate as his design was , it lacked the functionality or the authenticity of the genuine article
" i was frustrated every time i wore it , " gordon explains
" it really limited my mobility and i did n't like that -- it did n't go with the character
" in september 2014 he bit the bullet , deciding " to do another one that would n't inhibit my mobility and would actually provide protection and function more like batman 's actual suit
" the batsuit had to be strong -- tough enough to withstand the stab or slash of a knife , the impact of a punch or a baseball bat , but light and articulate enough to make it practical
striking such a balance required expensive materials , and they did n't come cheap
gordon therefore fired up a kickstarter campaign
he " did n't really think anyone would fund it or even be interested in it " -- he raised $ 1,255 in 6 days
" it was a little surprising , " gordon demurs
writing out his shopping list , it was important that " everywhere , even places without armor plating , had some sort of protection
" kevlar was sourced as the base fabric , making it " cut and slash resistant to bladed weapons , but breathable and wearable all day
" eschewing conventional materials , gordon opted for a form of memory foam , built around key areas to " squish and compress , " dissipating the impact of blows
after much experimenting with " polycarbonates and extruded pvc materials , " Â¼ " kydex ( or abs ) plastic formed the tough armor plates , located on the torso , forearms and shins
stab resistant , gordon says " it can take anything but a gunshot
" the cowl was more problematic , being " nearly impossible " to craft out of the same materials within the limits of his workshop
gordon therefore took a mold of his head using sintra plastic , " working on top of that with different sculpting clays and soft plastics to get it into a recognizable batman shape
" using a two part box mold gordon was able to create a " silicone jacket " of this , into which liquid polyurethane was poured , forming the final , " durable and functional " cowl
gordon ( who does n't appear to be related to gotham city 's police commissioner , james gordon ) is also an expert in shaolin kung fu : he is both brains and brawn , a cross between bruce wayne and batsuit designer lucius fox from nolan 's batman trilogy
legendary , the production company behind the films , has taken note of his design and given it their seal of approval
the batsuit has made appearances at conventions and proved a showstopper among his fellow students and the faculty
" people love the theatricality of it , " its designer says
that the product so closely mimics dc 's fantastical comic book creation has had resonance
he has already begun manufacturing the cowls for the public , with " fully adjustable " jackets going up for sale on his site armatus design " in the next couple of weeks
" the jackets have received particular attention
gordon has received " easily over 50 requests from people , " and not just from the cosplay community
" they range from recreational use to martial artists ... but also motorcycle and all terrain vehicle riders who want protective gear and prefer the look and functionality of [ gordon 's ] suit
" perhaps because of their versatility and the small matter of copyright issues , those that go on sale will not feature the iconic bat symbol
gordon says his fledgling business will remain small whilst he 's at university -- he has to finish he studies after all , and wo n't be using the project towards his degree credits
for now the batsuit and armatus design will remain a one man operation : such is the life of a superhero .

21 - year - old student jackson gordon has designed and built a functional batsuit
made with money raised on kickstarter , the outfit has received a prestigious endorsement
