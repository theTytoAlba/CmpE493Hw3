a high temperature of 63.5 degrees fahrenheit might sound like a pleasant day in early spring -- unless you 're in antarctica
the chilly continent recorded the temperature ( 15.5 degrees celsius ) on march 24 , possibly the highest ever recorded on antarctica , according to the weather underground

) the world meteorological organization , a specialized united nations agency , is in the process of setting up an international ad - hoc committee of about 10 blue - ribbon climatologists and meteorologists to begin collecting relevant evidence , said randy cerveny , the agency 's lead rapporteur of weather and climate extremes and arizona state university professor of geographical sciences
the committee will examine the equipment used to measure the temperature , whether it was in good working order , whether the correct monitoring procedures were followed , whether the equipment was placed in the correct location and whether the measurement is matched by corresponding records from surrounding stations , cerveny said
the committee will discuss the issues and make a recommendation to cerveny , who will make an official finding , probably by late summer or early fall
researchers who study climate change carefully watch weather changes in the antarctic region and elsewhere for evidence that the earth is getting warmer .

high temperatures are recorded on the northern tip of the antarctica peninsula
