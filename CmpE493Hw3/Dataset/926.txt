robert boardwine 's path to fatherhood was unconventional , but virginia 's appeals court said tuesday he is legally entitled to be a part of his son 's life
boardwine 's friend , joyce bruce , had used his sperm and a turkey baster to get pregnant
she thought after she learned she was with child that they should just be friends
she also thought that because they never had sex , she was entitled to be the boy 's sole parent , according to court documents
the court of appeals of virginia decided differently in weighing the commonwealth 's assisted conception statute and denying bruce 's appeal to deny boardwine visitation
it agreed with a circuit court ruling that method of insemination did n't come from medical technology
" the plain meaning of the term ' medical technology ' does not encompass a kitchen implement such as a turkey baster , " the appeals court wrote in its decision
bruce 's attorney , monica t. monday , said she would need to talk to her client before she can comment about whether they will file an appeal
boardwine initially was hesitant when bruce approached him in 2010 with the turkey baster idea , the court document says
they talked about writing their agreement down on paper , but that never happened
they tried the turkey baster method a few times
he 'd come over to her house , go to a room alone , bring his sperm in a plastic cup , they 'd chat , and he 'd leave
then she 'd use the kitchen utensil and wait
after she did n't get pregnant , she twice tried a fertility doctor
she and boardwine tried a few more times , and in july , she learned she was going to have a baby
boardwine came by the house with a stuffed bear and clothes for the baby
he thought he was going to be able to see the newborn as often as he wanted
she thought he could have " some involvement , " the appeals court decision says , but she would be the sole parent
he 'd be like any other friend , certainly not have formal visitation
over what to name the baby
they did n't speak for more than five months after that
the baby was born , and boardwine says he learned about the baby 's arrival from someone else
he went to the hospital and saw the boy at bruce 's home
joyce bruce said the visits were " strained
" she told boardwine to stop coming
so he took the matter to court
bruce argued that she used " noncoital reproductive technology " to get pregnant , and boardwine was technically a sperm donor
he argued that he always expected to be a dad , going to the kid 's games and taking part in making decisions on schools and medical needs
a court - ordered dna test proved boardwine is the biological father
the appeals court affirmed the lower court 's ruling , saying the turkey baster does n't constitute reproductive technology
boardwine was awarded joint legal custody and visitation
cnn also reached out to his attorney tuesday but did n't get a reply
cnn 's tony marco contributed to this report .

in july 2010 , joyce bruce got pregnant in an unusual way -- with repeated attempts using a turkey baster
the man who gave her his sperm wanted to have a role in his son 's life
they ended up in court , and he has won joint custody and visitation rights
