one summer a few years ago , frances bean cobain worked as an intern in the new york offices of rolling stone
frances -- the daughter of nirvana singer - guitarist kurt cobain and an executive producer of the new hbo documentary on his life , " kurt cobain : montage of heck " -- was " a 15 - year - old goth kid , so stoked , " she recalls with a laugh during a recent interview for the cover story in our new issue
she remembers providing research assistance on a cover about the jonas brothers -- and working in a cubicle across from a wall with a giant painting of kurt
" yeah , " frances says with a grin and mock - exasperation , " looking at my dad every day
" ( preview the cover story and listen to a previously unheard cobain song here
) that is one of many stories and revelations that come out over almost three hours late one afternoon in early march , as frances , now 22 and a visual artist , speaks publicly for the first time about her father ; life after his death ; her complex relationship with her mother , courtney love ; and the new film , written , directed and produced by brett morgen
" kurt got to the point where he eventually had to sacrifice every bit of who he was to his art , because the world demanded it of him , " frances says bluntly at one point
" i think that was one of the main triggers as to why he felt he did n't want to be here and everyone would be happier without him
" rolling stone : listen to a previously unheard kurt cobain song but " in reality , if he had lived , " she goes on , " i would have had a dad
and that would have been an incredible experience
" what follows are additional excerpts from a remarkable -- and moving -- conversation
how would you describe " montage of heck " ? it 's emotional journalism
it 's the closest thing to having kurt tell his own story in his own words -- by his own aesthetic , his own perception of the world
it paints a portrait of a man attempting to cope with being a human
when brett and i first met , i was very specific about what i wanted to see , how i wanted kurt to be represented
i told him , " i do n't want the mythology of kurt or the romanticism
" even though kurt died in the most horrific way possible , there is this mythology and romanticism that surrounds him , because he 's 27 forever
the shelf life of an artist or musician is n't particularly long
kurt has gotten to icon status because he will never age
he will always be that relevant in that time and always be beautiful
rolling stone : 17 young innovators shaking up the music industry there is , with any great artist , a little manic - ness and insanity
" tropic of cancer " is one of my favorite books
and [ author ] henry miller had this work ethic , where he would get out of bed every day and force himself to write five pages
it taught me that if you do the work , you progress
so many people are content to settle
my dad was exceptionally ambitious
but he had a lot thrown on him , exceeding his ambition
he wanted his band to be successful
but he did n't want to be the f --- --- voice of a generation
do you remember the first time you heard a nirvana record -- and knowing that was your father ? i 've talked to sean lennon about this
he had a few more years with his dad that you did
but for him , the records were a road into understanding his father after he was gone
i do n't really like nirvana that much [ grins ]
sorry , promotional people , universal
i 'm more into mercury rev , oasis , brian jonestown massacre [ laughs ]
the grunge scene is not what i 'm interested in
but " territorial pissings " [ on nevermind ] is a f --- --- great song
and " dumb " [ on in utero ] -- i cry every time i hear that song
it 's a stripped - down version of kurt 's perception of himself -- of himself on drugs , off drugs , feeling inadequate to be titled the voice of a generation
rolling stone : elton john , michael stipe defend transgender prisoners ' rights the irony is that he wrote it before nirvana made nevermind
it was projection , to something
there 's no way anyone can wrap their minds around that
did you feel awkward as a teenager , not being that interested in the music kurt made ? no. i would have felt more awkward if i 'd been a fan
i was around 15 when i realized he was inescapable
even if i was in a car and had the radio on , there 's my dad
he 's larger than life , and our culture is obsessed with dead musicians
we love to put them on a pedestal
if kurt had just been another guy who abandoned his family in the most awful way possible
he inspired people to put him on a pedestal , to become st. kurt
he became even bigger after he died than he was when he was alive
you do n't think it could have gotten any bigger
after the first screening i attended , there was a guy who said " montage of heck " was a very interesting film about people he did n't like
[ laughs ] that 's a pretty good description
rolling stone : a guide to cobain 's cinematic legacy i found it interesting that the way morgen told kurt 's story did n't evoke any sympathy for that viewer -- that kurt 's art did not resonate with him
all he saw was a personalty he did n't like
that is an interesting perspective
for me , the film provided a lot more factual information about my father -- not just tall tales that were misconstrued , misremembered , rehashed , retold 10 different ways
it was factual evidence of who my father was as a child , as a teenager , as a man , as a husband , as an artist
it explored every single aspect of who he was as a human being
what was it like hearing his voice ? i 've been hearing his voice forever , through his music
i was thinking more of his speaking voice
his speaking voice is sort of similar to mine
it 's sort of a monotone
the depth to it is similar to the way i speak
i do n't know what the f --- that is
i was n't even talking when he was around
do n't mistake the power of genes
it 's very weird how genes are
dave [ grohl ] , krist [ novoselic ] and pat [ smear ] came over to a house where i was living
it was the first time [ the ex-nirvana members ] had been together in a long time
and they had what i call the " k. c. jeebies , " which is when they see me , they see kurt
they look at me , and you can see they 're looking at a ghost
they were all getting the k. c. jeebies hardcore
dave said , " she is so much like kurt
" they were all talking amongst themselves , rehashing old stories i 'd heard a million times
i was sitting in a chair , chain - smoking , looking down like this [ affects total boredom ]
and they went , " you are doing exactly what your father would have done
" but i was glad they came over [ smiles ]
it was a cool experience , like having a nirvana reunion minus one
what do you want to do next , now that this film is coming out ? in being one of the executive producers , you 're stepping into the public at almost the same age your father was when he made nirvana 's first album
i like to think of it as poetic
oddly enough , being 22 , it 's the first year a fire has been lit under my ass -- not because of the documentary , just personally
i have this motivation and ambition that i did n't have before : " i want to go paint this painting
" the hardest part of doing anything creatively is just getting up and doing
once i get out of bed and get into my art room , i start painting
and i 'm doing it
