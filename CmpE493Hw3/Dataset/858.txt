" i really wanted to make some money
" an army air force veteran of world war ii , he studied architecture at the university of michigan and lawrence institute of technology near detroit , and worked for an architectural firm , but decided that drawing was n't the path to success
" i wanted to build
" in his autobiography , " threshold resistance : the extraordinary career of a luxury retailing pioneer , " taubman said that when he " looked over the horizon , i saw that there was money to be made by people who could build and own stores or , better yet , groups of stores
" he founded the taubman co. in 1950 and began to demonstrate what the company 's website calls an " ability to assess and overcome threshold resistance -- a phrase he coined to describe the psychological and physical barriers that keep a shopper from entering a store
" as the post-war growth of suburbia continued , retail developers like taubman began to consider what that might mean : more and more people needed places to shop
taubman embarked on multi-store developments in the 1950s , in places like flint and taylor , michigan , and in 1961 broke ground on his first large mall , the 350,000 - square - foot arborland project in ann arbor
" demographically , i looked at the numbers , and as far as i was concerned we could n't miss , " he recalled in 2007
" and we did n't

his designs evolved over the years to include not only enclosed malls but various styles of open - air developments
and his influence stretched far from the american soil and into the thriving markets of china and south korea
people we 've lost in 2015 taubman remained active until the end of his life
