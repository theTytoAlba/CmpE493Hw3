as art , film stills are often overlooked
the photographers tend to be anonymous ; it 's easy to imagine their work done by the director or cinematographer
their images are often lumped in with the promotional machinery : whether documenting the stars frolicking on set or getting down to business , it 's just another form of salesmanship
which is why the work of ernst haas is so striking
haas , one of the 20th century 's great photojournalists and image - makers -- an early member of the great magnum photos cooperative who was famous enough in his prime to have been the subject of a museum of modern art exhibit in 1962 -- was also a regular on movie sets
it was a necessity in those early days , said john jacob , the editor of a new book of haas ' movie photography , " ernst haas : on set
" " working on film sets was really important to magnum , and all of the photographers working with magnum in the ' 50s did films , " says jacob , now the mcevoy family curator for photography at the smithsonian american art museum
not only did the work pay off financially , but the photographers also established relationships with members of the industry , he said
and the stars and directors knew what they were getting : some of the best in the field
photographers such as haas were entrusted to bring their talent and style to the work
the photographers " are definitely producing work for posterity , that very much has their own fingerprint on it , " jacob said
such distinction is obvious from looking at haas ' work -- some of which is as famous as the movies he worked on
there 's a striking picture of orson welles in 1949 's " the third man , " hemmed in by the darkness in a way that suggests the shadowy themes of the classic film
another , of gregory peck and chuck connors in 1958 's " the big country , " is as dramatic as any full - scale movie duel
( westerns were a specialty
) but haas also has a way of documenting the artificiality of film work , whether it 's capturing the sprawling , workaday set of 1965 's " the greatest story ever told " or snapping a relaxed picture of barbara streisand as dolly levi in 1969 's " hello , dolly ! " social media follow @ cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography
the former is particularly interesting : an image of actors splayed on crosses for the crucifixion scene , surrounded by ladders , a camera crane , a painted scrim and several casually dressed crew members
jacob observes that in each of haas ' images there 's an eye for the unusual
the black - and - white work from " the greatest story ever told , " for example , is almost prayerful , while the color images call attention to the artificiality of film
and some of haas ' other color images , especially his work for 1961 's " west side story , " fit in neatly with others in his catalog , as haas was known for an impressionistic blur of hues that jacob calls " the haas effect
" haas died in 1986 , and despite being celebrated during his life , his name is somewhat forgotten these days
jacob hopes that " ernst haas : on set " reminds people just what a master he was
" a lot of these are familiar images , but you do n't necessarily associate them with haas , " he said
" on the other hand , people who know haas well do n't actually know this work , because it was work for hire and was n't ever put together in this way before
" ernst haas was an austrian photographer who passed away in 1986
he was a member of magnum photos .
