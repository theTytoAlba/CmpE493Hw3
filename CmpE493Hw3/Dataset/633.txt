duckie 's still got moves
on tuesday night 's " late late show " on cbs , actor jon cryer reprised the character 's record - store dance to otis redding 's " try a little tenderness , " right down to the wall - dancing , the counter-bashing and , of course , the trademark white shoes
in the original scene , one of the best - loved bits from the 1986 john hughes film , cryer dances around a record store , lip - syncing the song as he tries to win the affection of molly ringwald 's andie
in tuesday 's recreation , he dances in tandem with host james corden , who tweeted that he 'd " fulfilled a childhood dream " by re-creating the scene with cryer -- who turned 50 on thursday
" i watched that ' try a little tenderness ' dance routine so many times , the tape on the vhs wore out , " corden said on the show
like cryer , who has most recently appeared on " two and a half men , " many of the film 's original fans are well into middle age
but still some may have squealed like teenagers when they saw the routine .
