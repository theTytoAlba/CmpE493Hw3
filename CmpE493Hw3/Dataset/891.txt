from finding the right lighting , to which filter to chose : play the instagram videos below to find out how to supercharge your pictures for social media success
" good lighting for me makes a shot
if i 'm taking a portrait of someone , i 'd much prefer to use natural lighting than a light bulb or manufactured lighting ! " " i make use of the rule of thirds quite a lot : if you imagine the screen split up in three thirds , you place the subject in one corner
there 's a lot you can find about it on the internet
" " there 's a patch here of very bright light and just behind it there 's dark
trying to expose it right can be tricky but on the iphone you can do it quite well just by tapping the screen and dragging the exposure up and down
" " i 'll upload a photo to an app called snapseed , edit the brightness and contrast in that a little bit , export it
and then open in another app called vsco cam , which is my favorite app on my whole phone
" " on vsco cam there 's tons of filters , the one i use the most is probably " p5 , " then i can edit all sorts ... and once i 'm done i just export it and post it on instagram
" " i know photographers who use a lot of hashtags , and hashtags can work if you want to build up your follower base , because a lot more people will probably see a photo than if you did n't hashtag it
