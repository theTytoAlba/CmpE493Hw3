tmz sports released video last week that shows a group of police officers arresting the 6 - foot - 7 sefolosha and taking him to the ground

sefolosha did not specify his injury in his statement tuesday , but the hawks said last week that he has a fractured fibula and ligament damage , will undergo surgery and will miss the rest of the season , including the playoffs , which begin this weekend

" i am extremely disappointed that i will not be able to join my teammates on the court during the playoffs and apologize to them for any distraction this incident has caused , " sefolosha said in his statement
" i will be cheering for them every step of the way and will be diligent in my rehabilitation
" on advice of counsel , i hope you can appreciate that i can not discuss the facts of the case
those questions will be answered by my attorney in a court of law
i will simply say that i am in great pain , have experienced a significant injury and that the injury was caused by the police

" antic , a 31 - year - old , 6 - foot - 11 center / forward , missed the april 8 game against the brooklyn nets , but has played since then
in a joint statement last week , sefolosha and antic said they will contest the charges
