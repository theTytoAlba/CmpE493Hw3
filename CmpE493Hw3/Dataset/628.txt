a u.s. citizen with alleged ties to al qaeda did not enter a plea during his initial court appearance thursday on charges of conspiring to provide material support to terrorists
muhanad mahmoud al farekh , 29 , was deported from pakistan to the united states
he 's accused of plotting to fight against american forces abroad , according to a complaint unsealed in u.s. district court for the eastern district of new york in brooklyn
" this is news for celebration , " said cnn counterterrorism analyst philip mudd
" pretty simple reason why : if you look at a case like this , i think most americans would say the significance of this case is that this guy , an american , is going to come back home and conduct an attack
instead , you should look at him as a ... facilitator
" he 's not going to burn himself by coming back
he 's going to serve as the conduit or known in pakistan who understands the west , how you travel , how you stay out of the clutches of law enforcement and he also understands al qaeda in pakistan
those people are really hard to come by
this is a great catch not because he was a potential bomber but because he could have trained tens of bombers
" farekh 's court appearance comes on the same day that federal prosecutors announced the arrests of two new york women accused of planning to build an explosive device for an attack on u.s. soil
