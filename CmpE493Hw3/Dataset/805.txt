the force is strong in turkey -- or at least it appears to be at one university where thousands of students are petitioning for a jedi temple to be built on campus
the petition , which was started by a student at dokuz eylul university in the western province of izmir , so far has almost 5,500 signatures
" there are less and less jedi left on the earth , " the petition says
it adds that " uneducated padawan " -- the novice jedis in george lucas ' " star wars " film franchise -- " are moving to the dark side
... to find the balance in the force , we want a jedi temple
" the page on change.org also features a still of jedi grand master yoda from " star wars : episode ii -- attack of the clones " teaching young jedis how to use a light saber
" i 'm signing because the nearest temple ( is ) billions of light years away , " one supporter wrote on the petition page
another supporter wrote : " we want freedom of worship
there are mosques everywhere , but no jedi temple ! " the petition was started by akin cagatay caliskan , an 18 - year - old computer science student from ankara
caliskan says he is surprised by the impact his petition has made : " i did not expect so many supporters
i thought maybe it might ( have ) 100
" the satirical document does have a serious side
an online debate started last month when mehmet karaca , the rector of istanbul technical university , said he would build a mosque on campus if there was enough support
karaca was referencing another petition asking a mosque be built on campus , which almost 200,000 students signed
twenty thousand students at itu also signed a separate petition in response , demanding a buddhist temple on campus
" i can not fulfill my religious needs " and can not afford " to go to the nearest buddhist temple 2,000 miles away , " utku gurcag boratac from istanbul wrote as her reason for signing
" i want to fulfill my religious needs on campus , " said another
this is just the latest flurry in a longstanding discussion around civil and religious freedoms in the secular republic
turkey 's secularist opposition has accused turkish president recep tayyip erdogan and his party , the islamist - based justice and development party , of trying to instill conservative islamic values into everyday life
late last year , the head of turkey 's islamic religious affairs authority , the diyanet , announced plans to build 80 mosques on university campuses across the country
the diyanet sparked discussion a few months earlier by opening a mosque on the campus of erzurum ataturk university in the eastern province of erzurum , according to turkish daily newspaper hurriyet .

5,500 signatures call for jedi temple after similar petition asked for campus mosque
petition started by a student at dokuz eylul university in the western province of izmir
