korea 's buddae - jjigae -- or " army stew " as it 's often called -- dates back to the scarce years of the korean war when local cooks had to get inventive with u.s. army rations
while jiigae can refer to any variety of stews , this particular version just happens to feature a variety of canned , precooked meat , most notably spam in all its glazed and gelatinous glory
" it 's , in fact , a classic example of necessity being the mother of deliciousness , " anthony bourdain says of the dish during the premiere episode of " parts unknown " on sunday , april 26 , at 9 p.m. et / pt. the host of cnn 's " parts unknown " recently stopped by anderson cooper 's kitchen to cook up the spicy and funky stew , and talk about his 24 intoxicating hours in the country 's capital of seoul
so , it 's probably a good thing budda - jiigae is also a storied hangover cure
