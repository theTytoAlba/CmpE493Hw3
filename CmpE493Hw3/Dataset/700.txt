recently , nashville 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals
believe it or not , nashville prosecutors have offered this option four times in the past five years
there has been public outrage at the notion that a defendant in america in 2015 would be offered a choice of sterilization as part of a plea deal
except , it happens all the time
some have claimed this practice " evokes a dark corner of american history " where the mentally ill or " deficient " were forced to undergo sterilization
yeah , that 's true
except this is n't quite that
female sterilization is linked to the controversial " eugenics " movement , which advocated for the notion that the human race can be improved by selective breeding of people with superior genes
there is even a 1927 supreme court case , buck v. bell , in which the justices ruled that a state statute permitting compulsory sterilization of the unfit and " imbeciles , " " for the protection and health of the state , " was constitutional
the opinion in the case is stunning , especially because the supreme court has never technically overruled it
but buck v. bell dealt with involuntary sterilization of people because of their mental disabilities , not because they were being punished for a crime
you can hate sterilization , and the tennessee case may have the creepy feel of the antiquated practice of eugenics , but it 's not that
present - day sterilization plea deals involve a voluntary choice of sterilization by persons accused of a crime , and for whom sterilization will be part of their punishment
others may argue that the supreme court has already spoken on the issue of compulsory sterilization as punishment , and struck it down
that 's true too , sort of
in skinner v. oklahoma , the court struck down a law permitting compulsory sterilization of criminals as unconstitutional , but not because it was cruel and unusual
instead , the law was struck down because the law was unequally applied for similar crimes
so the question remains : is sterilization as a punishment unconstitutional ? the eighth amendment provides : " excessive bail shall not be required , nor excessive fines imposed , nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted
" practically , however , punishments are rarely deemed cruel and unusual by the judiciary
we have executed people with hangings and by firing squad
sterilization has to be somewhere below that , right ? ultimately , however , the constitutionality of sterilization may be a red herring in this analysis , because it appears that even if a punishment vciolates the constitution , it is permissible , if you willingly choose it
suppose arguendo ( for argument 's sake ) that sterilization is judicially labeled a cruel and unusual punishment , violating the eighth amendment
this is where it gets interesting : it still might be an appropriate and constitutional part of a plea deal
shocked ? you should n't be
as citizens , we validly waive our constitutional rights all the time
you waive your fourth amendment protections against search and seizure when you answer " yes " to an officer 's " mind if i look in your trunk ? " you waive your fifth amendment privilege against self - incrimination when you try to explain to the detective in the interrogation room how that body got in your vehicle 's trunk
so then , if we can validly waive our other constitutional rights , can we waive our eighth amendment rights and choose a cruel and unusual punishment , even if it would otherwise be unconstitutional ? and are people outraged because this is a new step in punishment or a new frontier and a slippery slope in the world of plea deals ? nope
sterilization statutes have been around for a while as punishment for defendants all over the country , and defendants have willingly chosen the procedure
if sterilization plea deals are likely constitutional , and we 've been doing it for a while , then that begs the question : why the outrage now ? why the story that a tennessee prosecutor was fired for a plea bargain that appears to be widely practiced ? there are really only two possibilities
first , some people just had no idea that this was going on until this story hit the news
second , even if we knew about it , we did n't mind the practice until now because of one fundamental difference
most of the sterilization defendants are men
search your feelings , luke
when we talk about castrating men who are recidivist sexual predators and child molesters , the idea of castration as punishment does n't sound so bad right ? be honest : let go of your " we 're - all - equal - in - all - ways " banner for a moment
after all , not too long ago , execution was a legal punishment for nonhomicide sex crimes in some jurisdictions
so if we 're ok with the gas chamber , we 're probably ok with a snip
you can admit it ; we are all hardwired with a modicum of gender bias , whether we like it or not
still not convinced ? watch this parlor trick : what if i suggested sterilization for a person convicted of having sex with a minor ? so far you 're not ruling it out
and what if it 's a young female high school teacher having sex with her 17 - year - old student ? most of our gut feelings shifted from " maybe " to " no " just now
it 's ok to admit that , too
of course , sterilization wo n't prevent a female sex offender from offending again , no more than sterilization will prevent a male offender from offending again
but the point is , somehow , the notion of sterilizing a male criminal somehow sits better with us than sterilizing a female criminal
maybe it 's that on a primal , unconscious level , what feels cruel and unusual punishment for a woman just feels less so for a man
even if you 're offended by this theory of why an old practice is now a " shocking " news story , you must concede it fits
why else has castration of men not been a blip on the radar , but offering a woman the option of sterilization is suddenly a travesty ? of course , we have to consider the related justification
overall , a lot more men commit acts that merit sterilization than do women
just ask any domestic violence prosecutor
are sterilization plea deals morally right ? it 's hard to say
for now , they appear to be constitutional , but controversial
if we know a mother is likely to kill or seriously hurt her current children or her unborn child , should the government step in ? if so , to what degree ? fortunately , we can avoid a final decision and continue to attack the problem in a way that seems to be more acceptable for now : just keep neutering the men .
