in russia 's tightly - managed democracy , where being an opposition politician can seriously damage your health , chances to question the country 's leader are rare
president vladimir putin cuts an isolated figure , closely guarded behind the walls of the kremlin , traveling to - and - fro by helicopter or high - speed motorcade
his almost daily appearances on state television often show him in formal meetings with subordinates , or visiting dignitaries
interaction with ordinary russians is usually carefully controlled and fleeting
that is why this annual q&a session -- in which putin will spend hours fielding questions from the general public on live television -- is such a widely anticipated event which provokes such excitement
it is direct access to the russian leader , or at least as direct as most russians will ever get
in recent years , sitting in a shiny studio surrounded by a hand - picked audience of soldiers , doctors , teachers , factory workers and so on , putin has held forth on subjects from parenting to food prices , to relations with america
last year he spoke for three hours and 55 minutes
in 2013 , it was a record - breaking 4 hours and 47 minutes
organizers say this year , public interest is especially strong
at one call center in moscow , where the public are encouraged to pitch their putin questions , officials say more than 200,000 questions were submitted in the first hour after lines opened
the kremlin says they will have to sift through well over 1.7 million emails , video messages and texts to decide who gets to ask what on the big day
a few would - be questions released ahead of the event give us a flavor of what 's on russia 's mind
one man , who identifies himself as vitaly from the leningrad region , asks : " vladimir vladimirovich ( putin 's middle name ) , why are prices going up in the shops but wages are staying the same ? " sanctions and russia 's deep economic crisis , which saw the value of the russian currency , the ruble , plunge in value by 50 % against the dollar , is set to be a major a theme
so too is foreign policy
with moscow at odds with the west over ukraine , some of the released questions show how concerned ordinary russians are about their country 's place in the world
one unidentified schoolgirl asks : " is there a threat to russia 's interests from the united states and europe ? and will there be a new iron curtain ? " it 's not just russian schoolchildren who want to hear putin 's answer
critics of the kremlin , of course , slam this entire event as russia 's imitation of democracy in action
it 's hard to imagine a truly critical question , they say , getting aired on national television here
in fact , its best not to look at this event as an opportunity for russians to question their leader at all
instead , it is more like a highly produced , highly choreographed chance for their leader to speak to them , and to the world
sometimes , the kremlin likes to throw in a nasty surprise , too
last year saw nsa whistleblower , edward snowden , granted asylum in russia , address putin by videolink
who knows who may pop up this time .
