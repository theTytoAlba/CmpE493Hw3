boston when the bomb went off , steve woolfenden thought he was still standing
that was because , as he lay on the ground , he was still holding the handles of his son 's stroller
he pulled back the stroller 's cover and saw that his son , leo , 3 , was conscious but bleeding from the left side of his head
woolfenden checked leo for other injuries and thought , " let 's get out of here
" that was before he noticed his achilles tendon , which resembled transparent tape covered in blood , and his left tibia protruding from his boot
the boot was next to his left stump , he testified before a federal jury thursday , the third day in which survivors and family members of those killed in the boston marathon bombing shared their stories -- often gruesome and heartbreaking -- in the sentencing phase for dzhokhar tsarnaev
the prosecution rested thursday afternoon after attempting to convince jurors that tsarnaev was cold - hearted and remorseless
the defense , led by famed death penalty opponent judy clarke , is expected to try to soften that portrayal by calling witnesses to explain tsarnaev 's difficult upbringing
clarke will begin those efforts monday
a group of tsarnaev 's relatives arrived at boston 's logan international airport on thursday , cnn affiliate whdh reported , but it 's not clear if they plan to testify
the jury must decide whether the 21 - year - old , who has been found guilty of perpetrating the attack with his now - deceased brother , will die for his crimes or spend his life in prison
woolfenden , a biomedical researcher for the novartis institutes , recalled using his belt as a tourniquet on his leg and trying to comfort leo
the boy cried , " mommy ! daddy ! mommy ! daddy ! mommy ! daddy ! mommy ! daddy ! " he testified
amid the stench of " burning hair , blood , sulfur , " a good samaritan emerged
he gave woolfenden another tourniquet and rushed leo to safety
" i was completely terrified because i did n't know if i was ever going to see my son again
there was blood all over the sidewalk , all around me , " he said
dr. david king , a trauma surgeon at massachusetts general hospital , spent 14 years in the u.s. army as a combat surgeon and served in iraq and afghanistan , as well as in haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake
he has treated and operated on hundreds of troops injured by improvised explosive devices , he testified , and what he saw in boston that day was n't much different from the carnage he witnessed in war zones
" i arrived just as the first wave of casualties had shown up , " he said
" i looked across the patients and i knew immediately , without anyone having to tell me , exactly what the wounding mechanism was
" heather abbott had no such experience , so when one of the two bombs exploded , sending her through the doors of a restaurant and into a " puddle of chaos and blood and glass , " her instinct was to run
her foot felt like it was on fire , she testified
two women helped her as she overheard someone saying a hail mary
she called for her husband
he picked her up and carried her out of the restaurant
" i saw blood pouring out of my foot , " she said
she finally got to a hospital , and after three attempts to save her foot , which was missing its entire heel , a doctor told her she had a decision : she could keep her leg and risk a life of excruciating pain or have it amputated below the knee
" it was probably the hardest decision i 've had to make , " she testified
another marathon attendee rendered an amputee by the tsarnaev brothers ' attack , marc fucarile , recounted the two bombs going off
" i stepped back , and the next thing i remember was looking up at the sky , " he testified , adding that he remembered " a lot of yelling , a lot of screaming , people crying out for tourniquets
" a nurse was sitting on his chest , and someone said , " oh , s * * * , he 's on fire ! " he tried to undo his belt and got a third - degree burn because the buckle was so hot
a firefighter would later tell fucarile that he handed his own right leg to the firefighter
he does n't remember that
in addition to treating him for severe burns over much of his body , doctors had to cut off a bone and stretch muscle over the stub so that a prosthetic would fit
" so where the prosthetic attaches on your butt , it rubs and breaks down and creates open wounds , " he said
and though his left leg survived , it was severely burned , his calf muscle was blown off and his heel was shattered , he said
he hopes to save the left leg , he testified , but it 's likely that it will have to be amputated above the knee
he takes more than 70 pills -- 24 pills in morning , 22 in afternoon , 26 at night -- to cope with his injuries , he said
one of the most dramatic points in thursday 's testimony involved the death of young martin richard
the prosecution showed close - up video of the 8 - year - old , who was only 3Â½ feet from one of the bombs , according to the fbi 's re-creation of the crime scene
his parents , bill and denise , are opposed to tsarnaev receiving the death penalty and did not participate in the penalty phase , though bill richard did testify during the guilt phase
dr. king told the court that martin was especially vulnerable to the blast because he was so small and close to the ground , meaning the shrapnel more easily reached his head and torso
it 's highly unlikely the boy died instantly , king said
explaining that martin died of rapid blood loss , king testified , " receptors are generally not responsive to cutting
if you happen to be awake and someone cuts your bowel or liver , it generally does not hurt
what hurts is the stretching and twisting
... intestines were pulled and twisted ; that would have caused visceral type pain
" woolfenden , the biomedical researcher , recalled seeing martin and his mother shortly after the good samaritan took woolfenden 's son , leo , to safety
" i saw martin 's face , and i could see a boy that looked like he was fatally injured , " he said , martin 's hair was singed , his eyes had rolled back into his head and his mouth was agape
as for martin 's torso , " i saw an immense amount of blood
i was really , really terrified , " woolfenden said
he recalled denise richard pleading with her son , saying , " please " and " martin " over and over
woolfenden placed his hand on denise richard 's back , he said
she turned to ask woolfenden if he was ok
he said he was , and she turned her attention back to martin
according to testimony , martin 's aorta was nearly severed and he was eviscerated by shrapnel from the blast
he bled to death on the sidewalk , and the last thing he probably felt was excruciating pain from the force of the blast twisting his internal organs
cnn 's patrick cornell contributed to this report .

tsarnaev family members arrive in boston , but it 's not clear if they 'll testify
a woman testifies that she had to choose whether to keep her leg ; some other victims had no choice
starting monday , the defense is expected to call witnesses to explain dzhokhar tsarnaev 's difficult upbringing
