following a recent state - wide ban on the sale and consumption of beef , authorities in the city have asked residents to take a ' mugshot ' of their cattle and submit it to the police
along with the photograph , the residents have to give information about their animal 's ' unique features , ' such as the coloring and age of the cow , along with the length of its tail and other distinctive characteristics
