two years ago in a less turbulent time , mike premeau and kathy danke launched a small business , memories gourmet pizza co. , in their wisconsin town
the two were successful in getting their line of frozen pizzas , including breakfast pizzas and gluten - free options , in stores across nichols , west of green bay
they grew a base of loyal customers
but all that was threatened this week when people began mistaking them for memories pizza of walkerton , indiana , which made national headlines after its owners said they would refuse to cater a same - sex wedding
people posted angry comments on memories gourmet pizza 's facebook page and called its phone number to protest
and almost overnight , premeau and danke found themselves thrust unwillingly into a national debate over indiana 's controversial religious freedom restoration act
" my stomach was in my throat all afternoon , " danke told cnn affiliates wbnd and wfrv
" all of a sudden , our facebook page started getting flooded , " premeau said
it was like i was a rat running around in a cage , wondering what 's going on here
" in a cruel coincidence , the flood of outrage began on wednesday , april fool 's day
" if i 'm ever in the area , i 'll be sure to starve to death before i give you and you intolerance any of my money ! " wrote one commenter on facebook
" i do n't have much of a message , except that i hope your bigotry puts you out of business very quickly , " a man said in a voice mail
indiana pizzeria finds itself at the center of ' religious freedom ' debate premeau thinks the firestorm was sparked by people googling " memories pizza " and confusing the two businesses -- despite the fact that nichols and walkerton are in separate states and almost 300 miles apart
he and danke tried to defuse the outcry with a facebook post saying in part , " we are not that company in indiana , nor do we agree or condone their words or actions
" in response , they began getting messages of support on facebook , along with a few sharp - tongued comments from supporters of the other memories pizza
premeau said he also got a call from a man whose initial post may have set off the social media storm , apologizing for the mistake
still , he worries that damage to his wholesale pizza business may have been done
" this misinformation and this defamation of character could cause me to lose the business over someone else 's identity in another state , " he said .
