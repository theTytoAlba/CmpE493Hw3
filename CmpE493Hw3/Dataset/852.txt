shanghai , china volvo says it will begin exporting vehicles made in a factory in southwest china to the united states next month , the first time chinese - built passenger cars will roll into american showrooms
parent company geely automobile , which bought volvo in 2010 , is seeking to prove that a chinese company can manage a global auto brand
geely 's gambit will be watched to see if it paves the way for other chinese car manufacturers to crack developed markets
ceo h√•kan samuelsson said volvo planned to sell 1,500 chinese - made s60 inscription sedans in 2015 and 5,000 annually in subsequent years
for many u.s. consumers , china is still more closely linked with cheap clothing and electronics than luxury vehicles , but samuelsson downplayed any concerns about quality
" we do n't highlight where the vehicle is built but we do n't keep it a secret
we sell them as volvos and we know they are exactly the same in quality no matter where they are produced , " he told cnn
the car will be one of four models produced in a manufacturing plant in chengdu that opened in 2013
but given that volvo 's brand is staked on its reputation for safety , analysts said the company will have to tread carefully
" they have a strong enough reputation no matter where they 're made
they will have to make sure they do n't ruin that perception with any quality issues , " said raymond tsang , a shanghai - based partner at consultants bain & company
china surpassed the u.s. as the largest market for car sales globally in 2009 , and most major automakers build cars in china
but until now those cars have been sold almost exclusively in china
chinese car manufacturers like geely and its rival great wall motor do export their models to countries in africa , the middle east and eastern europe
but none have so far dared tackle developed markets like the u.s. and western europe
geely chairman li shufu said he hoped the company would eventually become a global car brand , but said there were no current plans to begin export its home - grown brand to u.s. showrooms
" we have the ambition , yes ; determination yes , but i 'm also [ a ] very realistic person , " he said
industry analysts say it 's unlikely we will see chinese car makers shake up the u.s. car market in the same way japanese and south korean manufacturers did decades earlier , at least in the near future
" hyundai and toyota are now extremely successful but it took them decades to move away from being perceived as lower end and lower quality than u.s. cars , " said tsang
" and now the market is even more competitive , especially for entry level models

but it 's unlikely that chinese car brands will take on developed markets
