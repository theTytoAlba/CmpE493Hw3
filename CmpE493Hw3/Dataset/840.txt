" the call was recorded and transferred to the police 's cad ( computer - aided dispatch ) system , " the statement said
" a grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required
we are now investigating why this grade was applied to the call

" the theft was so big that police have n't come up with a value for what was stolen
over the four - day easter holiday , thieves broke into the vault of hatton garden safe deposit ltd. and might have been able to take as long as four days to rifle through the boxes
a former police official in london has speculated that the loss could run to Â£ 200 million , or $ 300 million , in a remark widely reported by news media
numerous british news organizations put the value of the loss in the hundreds of thousands of pounds
detective chief inspector paul johnson of the london metropolitan police flying squad said police were still identifying the owners of ransacked safe deposit boxes and trying to contact them to learn what had been lost
the british tabloid the daily mirror claimed friday to have obtained closed - circuit tv footage that captured the robbery being carried out
the video showed people inside the building dressed like utility workers with their faces covered
they carried large bags , what looked like drill equipment and other tools , then exited with trash bins
toward the end of the video , a white van can be seen on a street during daytime with individuals loading back their gear and the trash bins
british police told cnn they have not released any video of the heist
when asked about the video published by the daily mirror , police said they could not confirm that it was footage from the hatton garden robbery and that officers have not seen that particular video
the daily mirror published time - stamped images it said showed that the thieves had been -- as was feared -- in the vault for days
the mirror 's time stamps , which cnn has not been able to independently verify , show employees locking up for the weekend at 9:19 p.m. on thursday
if the footage , and its interpretation by the newspaper are correct , at least six people were involved in the heist just four minutes later , the first of the thieves , nicknamed " mr. ginger " by the newspaper for his red hair , appears in the building holding a black bag
he goes downstairs toward the vault
at 9:27 p.m. , a street camera shows a white ford transit van pulling up to an alley beside the hatton garden safe deposit building
men are seen dragging trash bins down the alley before the van drives away , leaving the men behind
inside the building , at 9:30p.m
, the camera records a thief nicknamed " the gent " for his natty clothing -- though he also wears a hard - hat and a high - visibility jacket labeled " gas " on the back
a minute later , " mr. strong " appears , wearing a builder 's hat and carrying steel supports , which the newspaper speculates could have been used to support the diamond - tipped drill used to smash through the wall of the vault
at 9:36 p.m. , mr. strong and a thief nicknamed mr. montana for the logo on his hooded sweatshirt roll in trash bins , one of which might have contained , according the mirror , the 77 - pound drill that bored through the reinforced seven - foot concrete wall to reach the vault
it is unclear , but the thieves may have spent the night in the basement in or near the vault
at any rate , according to the daily mirror , no more activity is seen above ground until friday morning , shortly before 8:00
the white van returns , is loaded in two minutes , and drives off again
on saturday evening , mr. ginger returns , two days after he was first seen

early sunday , mr ginger , the tall man and a robber nicknamed the old man are seen to be active
the tall man and the old man struggle to move a bin before they drag it outside
the old man leans on the bin , struggling for breath , and reveals the side of his face to the camera

three men get into the white van and , at 6:44 a.m. they are gone
the heist would not be reported to police for two more days , on tuesday morning when employees of the company arrived for work
police said thursday there was no sign of forced entry
johnson said the thieves appeared to have gained access to the vault through the shaft of an elevator that is used by several businesses in the building
the thieves disabled the elevator on the second floor of the building -- which would be called the third floor in the united states -- then climbed down the elevator shaft into the basement , he said
once there , he said , they used a drill to bore through a 6 - foot - thick wall and gain access to the vault where the safe deposit boxes were
people with knowledge of the area have speculated that cash and jewels were probably taken
some jewelry businesses reportedly stored some of their jewels in the boxes rather than leaving it in their stores over the holiday weekend
johnson said the scene in the vault remained chaotic as police continued their forensic examination
he said the floor was covered with dust and littered with safe deposit boxes and power tools
