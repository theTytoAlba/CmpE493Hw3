there are two paths to practicing medicine in america
there 's the traditional , time - tested way , where new doctors graduate from medical school and then pass a series of national exams while training for years as resident physicians
then there 's the approach being forged in florida and arizona : getting elected to a state legislature
lawmakers in those states are too often donning the white coats to orchestrate medical practice
in 2011 , florida enacted the firearm owners ' privacy act , which threatens prosecution and loss of licensure for any physicians who dare ask their patients about gun ownership and gun safety
guns are a scientifically uncontested health risk
asking about them is standard practice in pediatrics and psychiatry
i treat brain injuries , and it 's part of my job to talk with patients about things that might be unsafe for them , like driving
some of those i treat suffered their injuries by bullets , typically fired by family members or themselves
does anyone really believe i should n't talk about gun safety in these cases ? it 's a good thing i do n't practice in florida
florida 's gun censorship law was dragged into court soon after the governor signed it , and while a three - judge appeals panel upheld the law last summer , doctors can still ask about guns while the full 11th circuit court of appeals decides whether it will take up the case , a decision that could come down any day , the president of the florida chapter of the american academy of pediatrics , dr. tommy schechtman , told me
he is a plaintiff in the case
in arizona , another assault on physician free speech is scheduled to go into effect this summer
bill 1318 goes a step beyond silencing doctors
it requires them to lie
the bill was originally a hum - drum attempt to block health plans from covering abortion services , a common state and federal strategy
but legislators slid in a last - minute provision mandating that physicians who prescribe the abortion pill ru - 486 tell patients the pill is reversible
that 's the opinion of a particular san diego doctor who says this can be done through risky , large doses of progesterone
but the doctor has n't proven his case , and his regimen is not recommended by the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists or the food and drug administration
any doctor is certainly within his or her rights to review the limited information available about the san diego regimen and decide whether to discuss it with patients , but actually requiring physicians to make claims most believe to be untrue and unsafe means the legislators are overstepping their bounds and interfering with the patient - doctor relationship
i can not imagine anyone attempting to put words into the mouth of a lawyer privately consulting with a client
why are physicians putting up with a professional assault the american bar association would never permit ? dr. ilana addis , chairwoman of the arizona chapter of the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists , told me the amendment was added shortly before she was scheduled to testify about the bill before the arizona house
while planned parenthood and the aclu joined her organization in criticizing the provision , the bill passed both chambers and was recently signed by the governor
there 's a common relationship shared by these laws , beyond turning doctors into government spokespeople
these laws capitalize on controversial issues to divide and conquer
physicians do n't all share the same opinions on abortion and guns any more than they all vote republican or democrat
this is part of the reason the key state physicians ' associations are n't taking the lead in battling these laws
the battle is left to the specialties most affected
in florida , that 's the state 's chapter of the american academy of pediatrics , since pediatricians are most likely to ask about guns in the home
in arizona , it 's the state chapter of the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists carrying the torch for physician free speech
the florida medical association did n't provide me with details about whether it has a lobbying effort against the gun law , and the arizona medical association told me in a statement that " arma 's policy is to take no position on abortion
" representing physicians as a whole , the state medical associations have the most political clout in statehouses
the massachusetts medical society ( mss ) tried to utilize that power recently when it decided to dedicate " doctor 's day " to the issue of physician free speech , highlighting the threat posed by florida 's gun law in particular
members are concerned about the precedent being set
arkansas enacted a law similar to arizona just days later
the american medical association can do more
it did file a friend - of - the - court brief as part of the florida legal challenge , but at this writing has n't weighed in on arizona
the ama did n't sign on to a statement released last week by the coalition to protect the patient - provider relationship that hits hard on the new abortion laws as an affront to good medical care
its huge lobbying operations are tied up in washington , while states are the main battleground over the integrity of medical practice
now that the ama has won the age - old " doc fix " battle , ending automatic medicare payment cuts to doctors , perhaps it will consider assigning some of its $ 18 million lobbying team to stand in for lackluster state affiliates who 've abdicated their responsibility to vigorously defend the medical profession
we have a surgeon general now , vivek murthy , and he is on a national listening tour while he prepares to announce his areas of policy focus on april 22 , jonathan beeton , a health and human services spokesman told me
i hope murthy will see beyond the bluster of abortion and gun politics and zero in on a key issue affecting public health -- free and unfettered communication between patients and doctors .

ford vox : florida law keeps doctors from talking gun safety with patients ; arizona law forces doctors to promote disputed abortion claim
he says doctor organizations are failing to defend medical profession against politically motivated interference by clueless lawmakers
