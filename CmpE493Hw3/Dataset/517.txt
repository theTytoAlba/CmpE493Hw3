feidin santana , the man who recorded a south carolina police officer fatally shooting a fleeing , unarmed man , told cnn on thursday night he was told by another cop to stop using his phone to capture the incident
" one of the officers told me to stop , but it was because i ( said ) to them that what they did it was an abuse and i witnessed everything , " he told cnn 's " anderson cooper 360 ˚
" santana told cooper an officer told him to wait where he was but eventually he left the scene to go to work
in other interviews , santana has said he feared for his life , which almost kept him from revealing the recording
santana recalled the moments when he recorded a roughly three - minute video of north charleston police officer michael slager shooting walter scott as scott was running away saturday
that evidence led to the officer 's firing and arrest on a murder charge
santana said when he first came on the scene while walking to his job he saw slager on top of scott , who was on the ground
he could hear the sound of a taser in use
at no time did santana see scott go after the taser
he believes scott was trying to get away
" mr. scott never tried to fight , " santana told cnn
police said slager used a taser against scott , but slager would also later tell a dispatcher that scott at some point had grabbed the taser
after slager shot scott five times , the officer went back to pick up something
santana thinks it was the taser but said he was n't 100 % sure what it was
neither the struggle nor the use of a taser was captured on video , because santana had yet to begin recording
what we know about officer slager the cell phone video , which santana revealed this week , reignited national outcries surrounding police treatment of african - americans and led to a murder charge against slager , who is white
police said slager pulled the 50 - year - old scott over for a nonworking brake light on saturday morning
scott , according to a dash cam video , fled from slager for unexplained reasons , and the officer chased him on foot
when santana 's video begins , scott starts running away from the officer , with scott 's back to slager
the video shows slager shooting at scott eight times before scott falls down
who was scott ? walter scott 's mother , judy scott , told cooper this week that she would want to thank santana for coming forward
he 's the ram in the bush -- i truly believe that , " judy scott said
" i think she was right , " he said
" god put me there for a reason
" judy scott said she could n't watch the whole recording
" when i saw my son running and i saw the policeman behind him , i could n't take it , " she said
" i had to turn away
i could n't handle it
in an interview with nbc 's matt lauer , santana suggested that he was giving media interviews in part to protect himself against retribution
" at some point i thought about staying anonymous , and do n't show my face , do n't talk about it
but ... if i would n't show my face , everybody over there knows , including the police , who i am , " santana said
santana did not say whether he had received threats
his attorney , todd rutherford , said santana 's video would be useful in an investigation -- not only into the shooting but also into whether scott received prompt medical attention
in the last half of the video , a second officer appears to examine scott with gloved hands
witness video , official accounts raise questions santana said after he stopped recording , he watched for a few more minutes but never saw anyone perform cpr
a police report says a third officer -- not shown in the video -- reported seeing an officer administering first aid , and that the third officer approached and helped that person " with first aid and cpr
" on wednesday , asked whether cpr was performed on scott , north charleston police chief eddie driggers said : " in the end of it ( the video ) , what i saw was ( what i ) believed to be a police officer removing the shirt of the individual and performing some type of life - saving ( procedure ) , but i 'm not sure what took place there
