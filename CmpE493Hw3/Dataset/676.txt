sleek chassis , alluring paintwork and a need for speed , but these are no ordinary motors
when pedal hits metal , an eco-friendly process gets set in motion
powered by electricity and engineered for efficiency , car enthusiasts from across africa are sparking home - grown concepts that have gotten experts revving
in zaria , a city in northern nigeria , a team of students from the ahmadu bello university are currently applying the final touches to the " abucar 2
" the students used locally available materials to build the vehicle , and even included recycled electrical components in the engine
while it runs on gasoline , the engine maximizes fuel efficiency and produces fewer emissions than normal cars
" we are sure we have a great car , " says the project 's supervisor muhammad dauda
" now we are focusing on making some final enhancements to hone the driving strategy -- this is just like formula one
" their compact creation , which was built over five months , will travel to the netherlands in may to compete in the european leg of this year 's shell eco-marathon -- the motoring competition rewards those who travel the longest distance using the least amount of fuel
but the team is also working towards a hybrid petro - electric motor , which they hope to unveil in 2016
at low speeds the vehicle will be powered by electricity alone , but at higher speeds both electric and petrol components will work together
between extremes , excess power generated by the engine recharges the batteries that power the electric motor
it 's the model that toyota uses in the prius
green - focused designs like these are increasingly needed on the continent , as some studies say 50 % of global emissions of organic carbon could come from africa in 2030
at may 's shell eco-marathon , abucar 's team will be hoping to race past the sleek " autonov iii " creation from the university of lagos
painted the colors of the nigerian flag and powered by a solar battery , the car 's aerodynamic teardrop shape helps minimize drag
constructing earlier iterations of this vehicle was put under stress in 2013 when university teachers went on a six month strike , but the industrial action did n't stop the team from tinkering with the electric engine
" we 've used small tires to reduce the overall weight of the vehicle , " explains team manager chukwuemeka isiogu
" we 've trained ourselves to just think about fuel efficiency and create the most efficient vehicle
" other eco-friendly engineers are less about sleek and more focused on comfort
uganda 's makerere university has produced a two - seater electric car called " kiira ev "
with a super-light fibreglass body and lithium ion battery , the car can go 50 miles on a single charge
the design project cost $ 35,000 , but the engineers made sure to include leather seats and a cd player
whilst working on the kiira , the team is also developing an 28 - seater electric bus which will run on a mixture of electric and solar power
innovative creations have also come from the university of benin in nigeria
their " tuke - tuke " car -- named after local mini-buses -- is made from locally available materials
the brake pads , for example , are made from palm kernels
tuke - tuke also has some key features that will come in handy when slipping through the city 's streets
windscreen wipers start automatically when rain hits the sensors , gears can be changed with the touch of a button and owners use their finger rather than a key to unlock the doors
and when it gets dark , the driver just needs to clap their hands to turn on the interior lights
elsewhere , engineers are working on green vehicles for the whole family
one ghanaian inventor is building suvs with electric motors powered by rechargeable batteries
apostle safo , who also founded a church , dreams big in his five - seater creations which are hand built in gomoa mpota , except for the headlights and tires
while he says the product will be affordable , it remains to be seen just how much a handmade suv would cost
these innovations certainly are impressive concepts , but it 's unlikely electric vehicles will be filling roads on the continent any time soon -- it is unclear how economically viable it would be for governments and companies to build the right number of charging points , but the issue of power itself is even more pressing
" reliability when it comes to electricity supply is key , " says south african sustainability consultant anthony dane
" convincing consumers across africa to invest in an electric vehicle whilst electricity shortages are such a major issue in so many communities is a challenge
