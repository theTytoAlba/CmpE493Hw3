the bored teenager who gunned down a college baseball player in oklahoma simply because he and his two friends " had nothing to do , " is now a convicted murderer
chancey allen luna was found guilty of first - degree murder friday for his role in the august 2013 drive - by shooting of christopher lane , a 23 - year - old college student in duncan , about 80 miles south of oklahoma city
luna was 16 at the time of the shooting
lane , an australian attending east central university , was jogging when he was shot in the back by a gun fired by luna
a jury recommended friday that luna spend life in prison without the possibility of parole , according to court records
because he was under 18 when the crime was committed , he is not eligible for the death penalty
he 'll be formally sentenced in june
the vehicle 's driver , michael jones , pleaded guilty in march to second - degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison
jones , who was 17 at the time of the murder , will be eligible for parole starting in 2051 , according to the oklahoma department of corrections
prosecutors dropped first - degree murder charges filed against the third suspect , then only 15 , after he agreed to testify against luna and jones , according to cnn affiliate kswo
he will now be tried as a juvenile with accessory to murder after the fact
duncan police chief danny ford told australian radio station 3aw that when police arrested the teens , jones offered a motive that made clear that lane , a baseball player on scholarship , was chosen at random
" we were bored and did n't have anything to do , so we decided to kill somebody
" after the verdict , luna appeared to be crying as deputies led him out of the courtroom in handcuffs , whimpering " i 'm sorry " to a reporter
