new york new york state authorities have issued a health alert following a dramatic spike in hospital visits for synthetic marijuana - related emergencies
gov. andrew cuomo said friday that more than 160 patients in nine days have been rushed to hospitals across the state for adverse reactions to synthetic cannabinoid , known as " spice " or " k2
" " spice " and other similar synthetic drugs are often marketed as legal plant material coated with chemicals that are supposed to mimic the effects of marijuana , according to a statement from the governor 's office
" since the exact compounds contained in synthetic cannabinoid products change so frequently , it 's often impossible for users to know exactly what they are putting in their body , " acting new york state health commissioner dr. howard zucker said
symptoms after use have a wide range of severity , from confusion , drowsiness and headaches to increased heart rate , seizures and loss of consciousness , according to the new york state department of health
synthetic marijuana is popular among teens because it is marketed as incense or natural products to " mask its true purpose , " the health department statement said
" young people may be fooled into thinking that these substances are safe because they are sold over the counter or are in colorful packaging , but they are not made for human consumption , " new york alcohol and substance abuse service s commissioner arlene gonzalez sanchez said
" they are dangerous and can have significant , long - term effects on the brain
" the recent surge is not isolated in new york ; other states across the country have noticed similar trends

mobile county alone has seen seven cases in 2015 so far , more than the entire previous year , the statement said
