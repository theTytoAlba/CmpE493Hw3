espn 's britt mchenry this week found herself in the news , rather than reporting on it , after a video surfaced showing her berating and belittling an employee of a tow company in arlington , virginia
among the highlights , as caught on tape and eventually uploaded to liveleak : " i 'm on television and you 're in a f * * king trailer , honey , " and " i would n't work at a scumbag place like this
makes my skin crawl even being here
" and , finally , " lose some weight , baby girl
" it 's pretty cringe - worthy stuff that seems difficult , if not impossible , to defend
mchenry quickly issued an apology , blaming the incident on a moment of intense frustration but admitting her mistake and accepting responsibility
it was , however , too late : the # firebrittmchenry hashtag was already trending on twitter , where she was called everything from classist , class-less , and " ugly on the inside " to a " sad , self - hating coward
" espn , meanwhile , announced that mchenry would be suspended for a week
certainly mchenry should have known better than to have used such words , even if that 's what she was thinking , least of all because in our youtube age , such missteps always come to light
but while mchenry 's reaction could very well have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement , evidence of a mean girl who never left high school , what 's also troubling is how quickly and gleefully the rest of us issued blame on mchenry without fully knowing -- or , it seems , caring about -- the other side of the story
the video that was released -- by the tow company -- was heavily edited and included only mchenry 's responses , not the comments of the employee who may have provoked her and contributed to an argument that clearly escalates as the video goes on
mchenry knew she was being taped ; at one point , she looks directly at the camera
the employee even threatens to make the video public
did mchenry keep going because she has that much of a self - destructive streak ? or because she truly could not help herself ? or was she confident that any video evidence would show that there were two people playing this particular game ? how britt mchenry could have responded these days , there 's nothing we love more than an example of a celebrity fall from grace , whether it 's lindsay lohan or brian williams or britt mchenry , who was judged not on the facts but on what we take particular joy in believing : that the over-privileged and semi-famous do not necessarily deserve a fair trial
the high price of public shaming online sure , mchenry probably feels entitled , but that 's our doing , too
we 're a society obsessed with putting celebrities on a pedestal -- celebrating them , compensating them
and yet when , in a moment of frustration and stress , mchenry lets the entitlement bestowed on her win out over taking a deep breath and walking away , we 're right there to demand to know what gives her the nerve
you know what gives her the nerve ? we do
( be honest : when is the last time you had a warm and fuzzy experience at the tow lot ? ) but we 're really no better than she is
the problem with social media , and our dependence on it , is that it allows people to present and receive whatever angle they want , biased or not , fair or not
it 's the " power of the press " without the objectivity or accountability demanded of the actual press
and it has enabled a dangerous vigilantism that makes those who use that power no different from the ones they are supposedly rallying against
who was worse : mchenry or the people who made that video public , and who did so without owning up to their part in the conversation ? who is worse : britt mchenry for childishly mocking a confrontational tow employee 's bad teeth , or the twitter masses who call for justice and " the return of class " -- who express views like , " part of me feels bad for britt mchenry
poor thing actually believes she was hired for ' brains ' and ' education ' ? should n't they question whether , in fact , mchenry could have actually been standing up for herself ? sorry to break it to you , but these days , we 're all bullies
at least britt mchenry owns up to it .
