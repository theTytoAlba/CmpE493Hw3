we want our killers to be kind
to walk into court and show remorse , tell us that they are really nice people who only did it because they feared for their lives , or they were temporarily insane
even though those things may not be true , too often they are accepted as legitimate excuses for murder
well , aaron hernandez , the former new england patriots tight end and now convicted murderer , made none of those excuses
he walked into court with an air of bravado , his head held high like the $ 40 million , nfl superstar he was just a couple of years ago
several times he was even caught winking at his fiancee , shayanna jenkins , during the trial
and we did n't like his swagger
hernandez did n't offer a plausible alibi
he did n't look ashamed or remorseful
his own attorney , james sultan , admitted that hernandez " witnessed " the killing of odin lloyd , " committed by somebody he knew , " but said his client did not commit the crime
even before the guilty verdict came down wednesday , for many -- at least those covering the trial -- audacity seemed to be the defendant 's biggest crime
" the arrogance of aaron hernandez , " a new yorker headline accused
i do n't get it
what does it matter that hernandez was arrogant in court , or walked with too much swagger , or even smiled at his girl ? like it or not , that is who he is
the evidence is what matters
and for once , this time it appears the jury carefully considered the damning mountain of circumstantial evidence against this defendant and came to the right decision : guilty of first - degree murder in the 2013 slaying of odin lloyd
hernandez , 25 , was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole
he was also found guilty of unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition
it was the right decision
still , it 's hard not to feel sadness over such a senseless waste of life for both lloyd and now hernandez , who were once friends
football was the best thing hernandez ever had , especially after he father died suddenly after a routine hernia surgery in 2006
after that his life got complicated
at 17 , hernandez went off to the university of florida and seemed headed for greatness
there he won the john mackey award as the nation 's best tight end and led the team in receiving during its 2009 bowl championship series win
but off the field , his life was to beginning to unravel
trouble started : bar fights , reports of marijuana use and failed drug tests
he was even questioned in relation to a shooting after a fight at a gainesville , florida , nightclub
by the time he was drafted in 2010 by the new england patriots , hernandez had already been labeled a " troubled player
" but neither the patriots nor the nfl has anything to be ashamed of in how they handled the hernandez case
they did everything right this time
hours after hernandez was charged with murder , he was let go from the team
and his coaches did n't spend any time trying to convince the public that their star tight end was a decent , family - loving guy , as the league has done too many times in the past when its players got in trouble
there 's no reason to second - guess what went wrong , to ask " how could a star nfler be a murderer ? " the nfl for the most part does a great job vetting its players , and certainly hernandez is an anomaly in the league , where despite the ugly headlines , the overwhelming majority of players are upstanding , law - abiding citizens
and patriots bashers ( me included ) would be mistaken to try to find fault with the team for drafting hernandez despite his troubled past
no one really knows what evil lurks in the hearts of others , even those closest to us
not the mothers whose sons go off and commit schoolyard killing sprees , or wives whose husbands gun down innocent people , and certainly not employers who are mostly concerned about performance on the job
there was no way to predict hernandez would end up a murderer
he was a guy who had all the talent and opportunity in the world , but he still went wrong
hernandez himself may have explained it best as he was being taken out of the courtroom : according to a law enforcement source close to the case , hernandez told officers escorting him , " ' hey man , i 'm going to miss you guys
... i do n't need any luck any more
' he gave you the impression , ' it 's kinda like no big deal
... it is what it is

roxanne jones : jury right to find hernandez guilty , but the waste of life for player and his victim is tragic
she says nfl , patriots knew his troubled past , but could not have predicted his actions , and both handled case well
