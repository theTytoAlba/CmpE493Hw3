just as the agency begins to recover from a series of high - profile missteps , the secret service is facing yet another scandal
a female employee accused xavier morales , a supervisor within the agency , of assault after he made sexual advances at her , according to the washington post
" the woman told police and agency investigators that morales , her boss , told her during the party at capitol city brewing company that he was in love with her and would like to have sex with her , " and later tried to kiss her in the office , according to a report from the washington post
during the incident , he " grabbed her arms when she resisted " and the two tussled until morales gave up , sources told the paper
the post reports that the march 31 party was in celebration of morales ' new assignment as head of the louisville field office
a secret service spokesperson confirms that morales was placed on administrative leave and his security clearance was suspended
this incident was first reported on april 2 , and secret service director joe clancy was briefed that afternoon
clancy called the allegations " very disturbing
" " any threats or violence that endangers our employees in the workplace is unacceptable and will not be tolerated , " he said in a statement
this is just the latest chapter for an organization embroiled in scandal over the past several months
last month , two top - ranking officials were suspended following an incident at a white house command post during an investigation of a possible bomb
clancy was not made aware of the episode until five days later
the agency has also faced scrutiny for another lapse in late january when a drone crash - landed on the white house lawn
secret service director julia pierson resigned in september after a fence - jumper gained access to the east room of the white house
earlier in september , an armed security contractor was allowed to get into an elevator with president barack obama during a trip to the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta
an independent report released in december found that the secret service is stretched " beyond its limits , " needing more training , more staff , and a director from outside its ranks
clancy , who formally assumed the post in february , is a 27 - year veteran of the agency
" it 's going to take time to change some of this culture , " clancy said at a house appropriations committee hearing last month
" there 's no excuse for this information not to come up the chain
that 's going to take time because i 'm going to have to build trust with our workforce
" the incident will be further investigated by the office of the inspector general .
