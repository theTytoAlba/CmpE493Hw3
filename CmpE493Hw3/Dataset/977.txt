tejano star selena , who died 20 years ago , is coming back in a big way : with a hologram - like figure
billboard reports that the singer 's family is creating a version of the singer that will be " walking , talking , singing and dancing digital embodiment " of her persona
" by no means is this something that 's creepy or weird , " her sister , suzette quintanilla , told billboard
" we think it 's something amazing
a lot of the new fans that did not get to experience what selena was about hopefully will be able to get a sense of her with this new technology that 's going to be coming out
" selena : 20 years after her death the technology is being handled by acrovirt llc , a nevada - based tech company
" using detailed individual personalized functions spanning the mind , brain and body , the individual 's digitized human essence will autonomously learn and react on behalf of its human counterpart 's , " the company explained
the project is being called " selena the one
" twenty years after she was killed by her fan club president , selena remains incredibly popular , with her facebook page recording 2 million likes and fans continuing to post videos and tributes
selena will be the first figure to use the acrovirt technology , quintanilla said
" i 'm excited at the fact that she will be the first ever , and the fact that she 's a latina makes it even more awesome , " she said
" it 's not about replacing selena in any shape , way or form ; it 's just something to help her legacy continue growing
" the family intends to expand her legacy in another way : with some new music
selena the one " will release new songs and videos , will collaborate with current hit artists , and aims to go on tour in 2018 , " said a statement on selena 's facebook page
selena is n't the first performer to try the virtual route
a michael jackson hologram appeared at the billboard music awards in 2014 , and a hologram of tupac shakur performed at coachella in 2012
but the new technology is a step forward , quintanilla said
" people do n't realize how fast technology is moving , " she told billboard
" this is something that we 're building for another two to three years , so when 2018 comes around they 'll be like , ' oh , ok , we get it
' " fans can join an indiegogo campaign , www.selenatheone.com , to support the launch
the campaign , which hopes to raise $ 500,000 , begins april 16
the commemorative fiesta de la flor in corpus christi , texas -- which celebrates her life -- is scheduled for april 17 and 18
