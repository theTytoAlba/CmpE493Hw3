pardon us , " lost " fans , but april 8 was n't only your day
yes , we know the significance of april 8 , 2015 , and the alignment of 4:23.42 p.m. on that date to everyone obsessed with the hit abc show , and we heard about the general geek - outs that were occurring
but do n't forget , april 8 was also " rex manning day
" twitter did n't , paying homage to the 1995 film " empire records " and the character of rex manning , played by the very dreamy maxwell caulfield
the movie -- also starring liv tyler , anthony lapaglia and ren√©e zellweger -- centers on an independent record store in delaware where , on april 8 , former pop idol manning is scheduled to make an in - store appearance
fret not if you missed it , as we have some other dates made famous by films that you are n't going to want to let pass you by : april 14 their love affair was doomed like two ships passing in the night , but it was so good while it lasted for jack and rose in the 1997 blockbuster movie " titanic
" the sketch jack does of his beloved is dated april 14 , 1912
the titanic sank on april 15 , 1912
april 25 thanks to the 2000 film " miss congeniality , " we now know that april 25 is the perfect date
just do n't forget to dress accordingly
october 3 " mean girls day " is officially october 3 , given that 's when aaron samuels ( omg , he is so hot ! ) asks cady what day it is
of course , she replies " it 's october 3
" honestly , any day is a good day to quote the 2004 film
october 21 , 2015 buckle up for this one
in the 1989 film " back to the future part ii , " marty mcfly and the gang travel to october 21 , 2015
we hope to be celebrating that in our flying car that we are still waiting on , please and thank you .

april 8 was huge for " lost " and " empire records " fans
april 14 , april 25 , october 21 are other big dates in movies
