do you know a hero ? nominations are open for cnn heroes 2015 a decade - long civil war had just ended in the country , and doyne witnessed its effects firsthand
she met women and children who were suffering , struggling to survive
" it changed me , " said doyne , now 28
" there were children with mallets that would go into the riverbed , pick up a big stone and break it into little , little pieces ( to sell )
and they were doing that all day , every day
" doyne called her parents and asked them to wire her the $ 5,000 she had earned babysitting
in 2006 , she purchased land in surkhet , a district in western nepal
she worked for two years with the local community to build the kopila valley children 's home
today , kopila -- which means " flower bud " in nepali -- is home to about 50 children , from infants to teenagers

below is an edited version of their conversation
cnn : how does it work , raising nearly 50 kids ? doyne : it 's communal living , for sure ! we 're a family of almost 50 kids ages 8 months to 16 years
everybody just pitches in and helps each other
they all have their chores
they all have their duties
and everybody cooks the meals together and makes sure that they do their part to make the home run smoothly
the staff at the home , we call them the aunties and the uncles
we wake up in the morning and go off to school
and then come home and do homework and eat our meals together , and everybody goes to bed at night
cnn : how does a child come to live in your home ? maggie doyne : our first priority as an organization is to keep a child with their family if at all possible
in order to come into the home , you need to have lost both parents , or in some rare cases have suffered extreme neglect , abuse or have a parent who 's incarcerated
we have to conduct a full investigation
so usually that involves going to the child 's village , making calls , doing police checks , getting documentation and paperwork
we have to dig up birth certificates , death certificates , make sure that everything lines up the way that they say it does
cnn : meanwhile , you have 350 children attending your school
what is their background ? doyne : every single year we 'll get from 1,000 to 1,500 applicants
and we choose the ones who are the most needful and really wo n't be in school without us
most of them live in one room , a mud hut
a lot of them are just in survival mode
we try to relieve the burden from the family , so that the child has food , medical care , books , zero fees for education
cnn : what have you learned working with the local community in nepal ? doyne : i learned very early on , from the beginning , that i could n't come in and just be like , " here , i have a vision
this is what we 're going to do
" that does n't work
it has to be slow ; it has to be organic
and it has to come from the community and be a " we " thing
it 's really important to me that this is a nepali project , working for nepal , for the community
so the faces that you see are strong nepali women and amazing nepali role - model men
cnn : how does the project continue to grow ? doyne : we started with the home and then school
we run the school lunch program
then we needed to keep our kids really healthy , so we started a small clinic and then a counseling center
from there we started getting more sustainable and growing our own food
and then from there we decided to start a women 's center
we just bought a new piece of property to create a totally green and sustainable off - the - grid campus
this year we converted to solar energy
so we 'll have a high school and then a day care , preschool , elementary , all the way up , and a vocational center where kids can become a thriving young adult with everything they need to succeed moving forward
it 's become so much more than just a little girl with a backpack and a big dream
it 's become a community
and i want to teach and have other people take this example and hope this sets a precedent for what our world can be and look like
