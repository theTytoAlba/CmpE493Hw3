seventy years ago , anne frank died of typhus in a nazi concentration camp at the age of 15
just two weeks after her supposed death on march 31 , 1945 , the bergen - belsen concentration camp where she had been imprisoned was liberated -- timing that showed how close the jewish diarist had been to surviving the holocaust
but new research released by the anne frank house shows that anne and her older sister , margot frank , died at least a month earlier than previously thought
researchers re-examined archives of the red cross , the international training service and the bergen - belsen memorial , along with testimonies of survivors
they concluded that anne and margot probably did not survive to march 1945 -- contradicting the date of death which had previously been determined by dutch authorities
in 1944 , anne and seven others hiding in the amsterdam secret annex were arrested and sent to the auschwitz - birkenau concentration camp
anne frank 's final entry that same year , anne and margot were separated from their mother and sent away to work as slave labor at the bergen - belsen camp in germany
days at the camp were filled with terror and dread , witnesses said
the sisters stayed in a section of the overcrowded camp with no lighting , little water and no latrine
they slept on lice - ridden straw and violent storms shredded the tents , according to the researchers
like the other prisoners , the sisters endured long hours at roll call
her classmate , nannette blitz , recalled seeing anne there in december 1944 : " she was no more than a skeleton by then
she was wrapped in a blanket ; she could n't bear to wear her clothes anymore because they were crawling with lice
" listen to anne frank 's friends describe her concentration camp experience as the russians advanced further , the bergen - belsen concentration camp became even more crowded , bringing more disease
a deadly typhus outbreak caused thousands to die each day
typhus is an infectious disease caused by lice that breaks out in places with poor hygiene
the disease causes high fever , chills and skin eruptions
" because of the lice infesting the bedstraw and her clothes , anne was exposed to the main carrier of epidemic typhus for an extended period , " museum researchers wrote
they concluded that it 's unlikely the sisters survived until march , because witnesses at the camp said the sisters both had symptoms before february 7
" most deaths caused by typhus occur around twelve days after the first symptoms appear , " wrote authors erika prins and gertjan broek
the exact dates of death for anne and margot remain unclear
" anne never gave up hope , " said blitz , her friend
" she was absolutely convinced she would survive
" her diary endures as one of the world 's most popular books
