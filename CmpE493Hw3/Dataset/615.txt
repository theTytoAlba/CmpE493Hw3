rebekah gregory blinked back tears as she thought about the verdict
it had been almost two years since dzhokhar tsarnaev and his brother planted bombs at the boston marathon , setting off deadly explosions that wounded her and hundreds of others
in court last month , she testified that one of the blasts on that day in 2013 left her lying in the street , staring at her own bones
now , jurors have found him guilty on all 30 counts he faced for the deadly bombings and their aftermath
but no verdict can ever totally make up for the pain , she said
" i do n't believe that there will ever be justice brought to this , no mater if he does get the death penalty or he remains in prison for the rest of his life , " she said , crying as she spoke to reporters outside her texas home
" i do believe , however , that he should be held accountable for his actions
and i 'm very thankful for each of the jury members that are making him do that
" gregory , who wrote a widely publicized letter to tsarnaev after testifying , said the trial has left her and other victims reeling from a flood of emotions as they relive horrifying memories , but it 's an important step
" everything is being brought up again full force
our lives will never ever be the same , but i hope with this we can move forward and remember that we are still here for a reason , that there 's a bigger plan , " she said
" i may be standing on one fake leg , but i 'm standing here , stronger than ever , because someone tried to destroy me , and he failed
" for gregory and others who lived through the 2013 attack , wednesday 's verdict brought a mix of emotions , from triumphant vows to move forward , to expressions of gratitude , to debate over whether tsarnaev should be sentenced to death
there were no outbursts inside the federal courthouse in boston
in fact , there was barely any peripheral noise as people sat on the edges of their seats
as tsarnaev fidgeted and scratched the back of his head , some survivors and victims ' family members lowered their heads and dabbed tears
as cnn 's alexandra field noted from inside the courtroom , " they 've waited a long time for this
" the family of sean collier , a 26 - year - old police officer shot to death in his patrol car on the campus of the massachusetts institute of technology , said tsarnaev and his brother , tamerlan , were terrorists who " failed monumentally " in striking fear in people
" while today 's verdict can never bring sean back , we are thankful that dzhokhar tsarnaev will be held accountable for the evil that he brought to so many families , " the collier family said in a written statement
to richard " dic " donohue , an mbta police officer left in a pool of blood after being wounded in a shootout with the tsarnaevs in watertown , the verdicts show that " as a society , ... terrorism will not prevail , and we will hold those accountable for their acts against our nation
" " justice has been served today , " donahue tweeted
survivor karen brassard said she needed to attend the trial to help her heal
she does n't believe dzhokhar tsarnaev 's brother tamerlan , now dead , persuaded him to take part in the plot , as the defense contended
dzhokhar , in her view , was " all in
" " obviously we are grateful for the outcome today , " brassard tolder reporters
" it 's not a happy occasion , but it 's something that we can put one more step behind us
" that sense of turning the page was echoed by bruce mendelsohn , who is among those who rushed to save lives at the marathon finish line
the verdicts mean that dzhokhar tsarnaev is no longer a bombing suspect -- he is now officially a " convicted killer
" you ca n't call it celebration
but there is a newfound peace of mind , at least , in and around boston
this was a community that suffered greatly after the bombing and subsequent manhunt
and they got through it by rallying around each other , a deep bond reflected in the mantra " boston strong
" that feeling was reaffirmed all around the city by wednesday 's verdict
and it 's evident in people like heather abbott , who lost her left leg below the knee
since then , she 's become a living example of someone who was n't stopped by the terror -- learning not only to walk again , but to run again
" nothing can ever replace the lives that were lost or changed forever , " abbott said wednesday on facebook
" but at least there is some relief in knowing that justice is served and responsibility will be taken
" that view was commonly shared
for those hurt -- physically , mentally , emotionally -- by the horrors of 2013 , wednesday was key to their progression
but it 's not the end of the road
the picture of him , bloodied , being rushed through the streets of boston by good samaritan carlos arredondo , became a symbol of the carnage and heroism from this attack
even after losing both his legs , jeff bauman has become a symbol since of resilience -- moving on with his life , by marrying and fathering a child
on wednesday , bauman said the verdict " will never replace the lives that were lost and so dramatically changed
" " but it is a relief , " he added , " and one step closer to closure
" cnn 's ann o'neill and steve almasy contributed to this report .

survivor bauman stresses " we will never replace the lives that were lost "
a man who was at the finish line is glad dzhokhar tsarnaev is now a " convicted killer "
" justice has been served today , " says a once wounded police officer
