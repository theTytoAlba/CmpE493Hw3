since the news broke last weekend that hillary clinton had declared her candidacy , notable among the blitz of news stories are the many that refer to her as the mononymous " hillary , " as if she were a pop star in a pantsuit
the new york post published an item titled " lena dunham backs hillary for president " while gossip site tmz refers to the former flotus , u.s. senator , and secretary of state on a first - name basis throughout its news story on the announcement
even the new republic posted a piece about the run called " there 's nothing inevitable about hillary
" she 's famous enough by now to go by one name , but should she ? while clinton is arguably more widely known than any of her to - date opponents , she 's also a former u.s. senator and secretary of state
and yet , despite her decorated career in government , we 've long called clinton by her first name , and her first name only , in a way we do n't do with men who have held similar , or even vaguely similar , positions of power
according to a university of utah study , clinton was called by her first name four times more than her 2008 rival , barack obama , and so it goes this time around
after all , rand 's also running for president
when those guys declared , however , they got headlines that included their last names
there 's a very good reason for that
presidential candidates are not just professionals , but professionals declaring their candidacy for a position that many consider to be the most powerful in the world
a position that not only deserves formality and respect , but within a global context seems to require it
being president of the united states is a serious job
are there " ted for president " signs in our future ? unlikely
were we encouraged to " vote for mitt " ? nope
the u.s. army , meanwhile , is one of the most regimented organizations in the world , whose values put dignity and respect at top priority
cadets do n't call their commanding officers by their first names , even -- maybe especially -- if they 're women
so why are we all referring to the possible next commander - in - chief as if we 're part of her circle of close pals ? before you point to the fact that clinton is not the first clinton to cross this particular political threshold , the issue at hand is not one of practicality : the american public is smart enough to distinguish between this clinton and that clinton
george w. bush was n't the first in his family to run for office , and when he did , legitimate newspapers did n't go around noting the " w " ( or even " dubya " ) was up for the job
he was just bush , as he should have been , just as clinton is just clinton , a woman who has done a very good job distinguishing herself from her husband without the need to be referred to by her first name in order to avoid a case of mistaken identity
of course , the mononymity does n't seem to be unwelcome : sections of clinton 's website invite readers to " like hillary on facebook " and read about " hillary 's story , " while the campaign 's official hashtag appears to be # hillary2016
her campaign chairman reportedly emailed potential campaign donors yesterday with the missive that " it 's official : hillary 's running for president
" perhaps clinton and her advisers believe the single name makes her more personable , and familiar
maybe it 's an effort to distance clinton from the other gender - based stereotype slapped on her the last time around , when she was " the bitch " to sarah palin 's " ditz
" but while we should like our president -- if not desire to have her as a personal friend -- it 's far more important to trust , and respect , her -- and that still requires a level of formality
it 's important for the american public to be able to imagine electing a leader not despite the fact that she 's a woman , or even because she 's a woman , but who , very simply , happens to be a woman
whether she endorses the idea or not , calling clinton by her first name serves to , at best , reinforce gender and workplace stereotypes -- that women need to be " approachable , " not abrasive or aloof , in order to get the job done and be liked while doing it -- and at worst , infantilize and put her in her place
there 's a reason , after all , that we address current and former presidents as mr. president when we meet them , and not " hey , jimmy ! " and if there 's a reason hillary clinton will be elected as our next president , it 's not because she let us call her hillary .

peggy drexler : media , even candidate herself call clinton just ' hillary . ' this reinforces stereotypes about women needing to be approachable
she says especially in global context , trust , respect important for the potential leader of free world , not familiarity . just ' hillary ' not appropriate
