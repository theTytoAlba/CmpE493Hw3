kathmandu , nepal the death toll from the devastating earthquake that struck nepal two days ago surged past 3,000 on monday , a government official said
the desperate search for survivors from the country 's worst natural disaster in more than 80 years continued
the number of people confirmed dead in nepal stands at 3,218 , said nepalese ministry of home affairs spokesman laxmi dhakal
india has reported 56 deaths , and china another 20
the death toll is expected to climb further as officials get information from the rugged countryside that makes up most of nepal
as day broke monday , nepal was still in survival mode after suffering a series of aftershocks following the huge initial quake on saturday
stunned residents wandered the streets of kathmandu , the capital city of roughly 3 million people that 's now the focus of international disaster relief efforts
people dug through piles of debris where their homes once stood , seeking pieces of their former lives and , possibly , family members
many of the injured were treated outside overflowing hospitals , where crowds of people gathered looking for relatives
dhakal , the government spokesman , said monday 6,525 people were reported to have been injured

but often , searchers have found bodies rather than survivors
and the odds of saving the living decrease as the crucial first 72 hours tick by
