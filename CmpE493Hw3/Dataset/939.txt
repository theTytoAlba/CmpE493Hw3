c - span 's live telecast of the white house correspondents ' association dinner on saturday night , hosted by cecily strong of " saturday night live , " was not strong 's finest hour , though the entire affair seemed like five of c - span 's longest hours
even so , there were some genuinely funny moments , although the ratio was low , and you had to be patient to get to them
but when you step back and look at the event as a whole , and appreciate what 's really happening -- in terms of press freedoms and even a u.s. president willing and able to poke fun at himself as well as others -- it 's hard not to think of this particular beltway - meets - showbiz event as a wonderfully american exercise in tolerance and good humor
that being said , it 's a very tough room -- and not just because the washington hilton ballroom is so cavernous
more than 2,000 credentialed white house journalists and their mostly celebrity guests convened for the occasion
and convened , and convened , and convened , as time dragged on and dinner was served late
president barack obama , as strong 's warm - up act , did n't hit the podium until 10:20 p.m. ( strong got her turn at 10:45
) obama , as in past years , came out strong -- a tough act to follow for any comedian
he had strong comedy lines and delivered them with timing that many stand - up comics would envy
noting his lame - duck status , obama said his advisers asked him if he had a bucket list
" i have something that rhymes with bucket list , " he claimed to have replied
obama , noting the night 's guest speaker , said , " on ' saturday night live , ' cecily impersonates cnn anchor brooke baldwin
" then , after a brief but well - timed pause , he added , " which is surprising , because usually , the only people impersonating journalists on cnn are journalists on cnn
" obama was nailing his own punch lines frequently , and perfectly
then , to up the ante on his time at the podium , he welcomed his " anger translator " -- a recurring character played by keegan - michael key on comedy central 's " key & peele
" it was a clever surprise , and the crowd reacted with surprising enthusiasm ( i would n't have presumed most of them knew of key 's character or his series ) , though key 's jokes lost something in the translation , and did n't pack the punch of obama 's
but the bit ended with a great twist : obama himself getting so worked up about a snowball being carried into congress to denounce global warming that the president 's " anger translator " had to calm obama down instead
and then came cecily strong , with a sly opening line referring not only to her appearance as one of the few female guest speakers at the correspondents ' dinner , but to the upcoming 2016 presidential election
" feels right , " she said , " to have a woman following president obama
" from there , the crowd seemed as tough as advertised , with " oohs " often as loud as laughter , as strong went from one target to another
she even got " oohs " when her targets were outside the room , as when she said , noting how obama has aged visibly in office , " your hair is so white now , it can talk back to the police
" but the seemingly tepid response to strong 's routine may have been partly due to the late hour
she came on after not only the dinner service and obama , but after scholarship awards , correspondent awards and tributes and other bits of official business
and her routine was n't over until 11:08 p.m. -- making it a longer tv show than even the emmys
before the main event finally began , c - span filled the time scanning the room with its cameras , but providing only ambient sound with very few identifying voice - overs or prerecorded features
once in a while , you could see someone recognizable in the large , oddly eclectic crowd : tea leoni , ivanka trump , larry wilmore , jane pauley
for the most part , though , it was like playing a frustratingly difficult beltway game of spot - the - face - in - the - crowd -- a sort of " who 's waldo ? " and after a few hours watching a gaggle of people chat and eat , all i wanted to do was go home
and i was already home
but i stayed tuned , just so i could watch , and grade , the results
final tally : obama gets an a- , keegan - michael key a c , cecily strong a b - , and the entire telecast and event an a + for democracy -- but a d as television .

david bianculli : correspondents ' dinner , and cecily strong as host , were mostly weak , but obama had some funny zingers
he says " anger translator " bit was funny , but crowd was tough on strong as event went on and on
