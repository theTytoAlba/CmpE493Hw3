kano , nigeria an explosion late thursday outside a bus station in the northeast nigerian city of gombe ‎ killed at least five people and injured more than a dozen others , witnesses said
the explosion outside the bauchi motor park ‎ happened around 8:30 p.m. after a woman left her explosives - laden handbag near a bus filling up with passengers
the bus was heading to the central nigerian city of jos , 125 kilometers away
" there has been an explosion just outside the motor park and five people have been killed while more than 12 others have been seriously injured , " said adamu saidu , an employee at the bus station
" some of the injured have had their limbs blown off ‎ and one of them has had his eye gouged out , " said saidu , who was involved in the evacuation of the victims to a hospital
the woman pretended to be going to jos and lingered around the bus , which was ‎ waiting to fill up with passengers , according to falalu tasiu , a grocer near the bus station
" the woman kept talking on the phone and dropped her bag beside the bus , pretending to be waiting for the bus to fill up , " tasiu said
" she moved towards shops overlooking the bus station as if she was going to buy something and disappeared
moments later the bag exploded and set the bus on fire , killing five people and inujuring around 15 others , " tasiu said
although no one has claimed responsibility for the attack , boko haram islamists have repeatedly carried out suicide and bombing attacks on bus stations and markets in gombe and other northern cities , making the group the main suspect
boko haram has in recent months been under sustained pressure from sweeping offensives from a four - nation regional alliance of nigeria , chad , niger and cameroon
the regional offensives have considerably weakened boko haram 's capabilities , which has prompted the islamists to resort to attacks on soft targets such as bus stations , markets and schools
the explosion was the first attack since nigeria held its presidential election at the weekend , which was won by opposition candidate muhammadu buhari , who vowed to crush boko haram when he assumes office in late may .
