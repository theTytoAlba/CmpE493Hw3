a freshly fallen tree in the roadway was jason warnock 's first clue
warnock was driving through a canyon in lewiston , idaho , on wednesday when he saw the tree , then looked up to see an suv dangling over the edge of a cliff
the only thing holding the gmc yukon and its terrified driver from a 30 - foot drop was a crumpled chain - link fence , still clinging to the earth above bryden canyon road
" i seen that guy hanging there and he was trying to beat the window out or the door open and i was like ' oh man , ' ' cause only like five links were hanging there , " warnock told kxly , a cnn affiliate
" i was like , i got ta do something and no one was doing anything
" what warnock did next , captured in a dramatic photo by lewiston tribune photographer barry kough , made headlines around the world
warnock dashed from his car and scrambled up a hill to the yukon and its driver , 23 - year - old matthew sitko , who appeared to be in shock
" i got up there and i was like , ' are you alright man ? ' he shook his head , yeah
i grabbed my snap - on multi-tool and it had jagged edges on each end
i hit the window three times and it did n't break
every time i hit it , the thing rocked like it was going to fall off , " warnock told kxly
sitko was finally able to get the passenger - side window down
warnock then reached in and pulled sitko out to safety -- a moment recorded by kough 's camera
" i left and got out of there before anyone knew who i was , " he said
he remained an unknown good samaritan , his identity a mystery , until kough 's picture of the daring rescue appeared in the lewiston paper and spread across the internet
" i do n't feel like i deserve any credit or anything , " warnock said
" i just did what anyone would do , went right back to work
" thanks to warnock , sitko went to the hospital with just minor injuries
" the lewiston police department would like to thank warnock for his quick and decisive actions in helping mr. sitko and preventing the situation from worsening , " said roger lanier , the interim police chief
jason warnock told kxly he did n't want or expect all the attention and would rather be fishing in the mountains than reading about himself .
