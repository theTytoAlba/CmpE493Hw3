a duke student has admitted to hanging a noose made of rope from a tree near a student union , university officials said thursday
the prestigious private school did n't identify the student , citing federal privacy laws
in a news release , it said the student was no longer on campus and will face student conduct review
the student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early wednesday , the university said
officials are still trying to determine if other people were involved
criminal investigations into the incident are ongoing as well
students and faculty members marched wednesday afternoon chanting " we are not afraid
we stand together , " after pictures of the noose were passed around on social media
at a forum held on the steps of duke chapel , close to where the noose was discovered at 2 a.m. , hundreds of people gathered
" you came here for the reason that you want to say with me , ' this is no duke we will accept
this is no duke we want
this is not the duke we 're here to experience
and this is not the duke we 're here to create , ' " duke president richard brodhead told the crowd
the incident is one of several recent racist events to affect college students
last month a fraternity at the university of oklahoma had its charter removed after a video surfaced showing members using the n - word and referring to lynching in a chant
in february , a noose was hung around the neck of a statue of a famous civil rights figure at the university of mississippi
a statement issued by duke said there was a previous report of hate speech directed at students on campus
in the news release , the vice president for student affairs called the noose incident a " cowardly act
" " to whomever committed this hateful and stupid act , i just want to say that if your intent was to create fear , it will have the opposite effect , " larry moneta said wednesday
