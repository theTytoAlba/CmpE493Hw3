five young men were arrested saturday in melbourne , australia , in what police called a major counterterrorism operation
three of the teens , all of them either 18 or 19 , have since been released " pending further enquiries , " australia 's federal police said , but two remain in custody
sevdet besim , 18 , has been charged with conspiring to commit a terrorist act , and was denied bail saturday
the other suspect , a 19 - year - old , has not yet appeared in court
" some evidence that we have collected at a couple of the scenes and some other information we have leads us to believe that this particular matter was isis - inspired , " said neil gaughan , acting deputy commissioner of the australian federal police
the suspects planned to attack during a major national commemoration in a week , prime minister tony abbott said saturday
" the act that we believe was in preparation involved attacks against police officers , " he said
there was also a risk to the public , police said
police said the suspects were targeting a ceremony on anzac day ( australia and new zealand army corps day ) , which is april 25 and this year is the centennial of the gallipoli campaign in world war i. abbott avoided the term isis -- or islamic state -- to call out those who authorities believed influenced the suspects
he instead referred to the group as the " daesh death cult , " employing the acronym that is transliterated from the group 's name in arabic
it 's a handle isis is known to loathe
police also distanced the suspects from any ethnic connection
the men " are individuals acting by themselves
they are not representatives of any religious , cultural or national group , " victoria police acting deputy commissioner shane patton said
" i think the entire australian community should be concerned about the young age of those particular men , " gaughan said
" and this is an issue not just with law enforcement , but for the broader community
... we need to get better in relation to identifying young men and woman involved in this type of behavior , at the very early stage
" the suspects were associates of 18 - year - old nadun haider , who was killed while stabbing officers at a police station in september , police said
abbott lamented a string of extremist attacks on australian soil
in december , australian authorities stormed a sydney chocolate cafe where a self - styled muslim cleric had been holding hostages , killing the gunman
two of the 17 hostages initially held by the gunman died
in february , two men were charged with plotting terror activities in sydney
despite distancing the suspects from religion , abbott did make a connection to the middle east
" there are now about a hundred australians who are fighting with terrorists in the middle east , " and another 150 people in australia support them with funds and recruiting , the prime minister said
in february , abbott announced tougher citizenship laws as a part of the government 's new counterterrorism strategy
authorities have suspended australian passports of those they suspect of terrorist activity
australians should be stoic about the threat of terrorism , abbott said saturday
" the best thing you can do in the face of those who would do us harm is live your life normally
" he asked australians to turn out in droves on anzac day
police said this particular threat had been fully contained .

three of the five teens released
one 18 - year - old suspect has been charged , report says
australian police said the suspects were allegedly planning an " isis - inspired " attack
