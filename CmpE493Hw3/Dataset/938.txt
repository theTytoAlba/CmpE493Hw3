" sopranos " theorists now have a little more to chew on
show creator david chase went through the famous final scene for dga quarterly and revealed the reasoning behind each shot
what he did n't reveal , however , was whether series protagonist tony soprano lives or dies
chase 's details are a master class on how to build tension in a seemingly nondescript situation , however
' sopranos ' ending ? let it be for those who do n't recall the finale , which aired in june 2007 , mobster tony soprano is meeting his family for dinner at holsten 's , a real - life diner and ice cream parlor in bloomfield , new jersey
he picks a song on the jukebox : journey 's " do n't stop believin '
" as the music plays , he waits in a booth , watching his wife and later his son come through the front door
his daughter is running late
it 's a seemingly harmless get - together , one that could have happened any time in tony 's life , but it 's fraught with tension , chase observes
the journey song " starts to build and build into something " ; a bell rings every time someone walks through the door , and tony looks up each time
and then there 's the man in the members only jacket who walks in just ahead of a.j. , tony 's son
he could be anybody , but given tony 's life , he could a hitman assigned to kill tony
" the tension is quite high now , but if you think about it , for no real reason , " chase told dga quarterly
" who 's in the place ? a guy in a jacket , cub scouts , a young couple , a trucker in a hat , a couple of black guys in there to buy some candy
there 's no real reason for the tension to ratchet up
and that 's what i love , how you make that
" there are nods to other films , chase observed
the way the scene is cut recalls the final bedroom scene of stanley kubrick 's " 2001 : a space odyssey , " with tony seeing himself at the next spot in time
the members only guy going to the bathroom is a nod to the famous scene in " the godfather " when michael corleone shoots sollozzo and mccluskey
the scene ends , of course , with tony looking up as journey 's steve perry sings " do n't stop -- " and then a cut to black
the public reaction caught chase by surprise
" i thought the ending would be somewhat jarring , sure
but not to the extent it was , and not a subject of such discussion , " he said
" the biggest feeling i was going for , honestly , was do n't stop believing
" still , if anybody is hoping that chase reveals whether tony survives , they 'll have to keep digging
the end is deliberately uncertain and existential , chase said
" whether this is the end here , or not , it 's going to come at some point for the rest of us , " he said
" i 'm not saying that ( he was killed )
but obviously he stood more of a chance of getting shot by a rival gang mob than you or i do because he put himself in that situation
" all i know , " he added , " is the end is coming for all of us

david chase walks through the ending of " the sopranos "
the use of particular shots and " do n't stop believin ' " build tension
chase still does n't reveal tony soprano 's fate
