dubai it 's with some trepidation that i set off for the al marmoum camel race in dubai
as the only gulf national in the cnn team , i am expected to be familiar with camel racing , an ancient tradition in the region
but despite my attempts to dress in a kandora , a uae national dress , my modern outlook on life means i am a total outsider in this world
a cheerful farm owner leads us inside the majlis -- meeting area -- where the camel owners are gathering
the wide space of the majlis feels like an ornate theater
the camel owners are sitting on the floor , eating the a'aish , a traditional arabic dish of fish and rice , laid out in front of them
the conversation is loud and exciting
we take our place on the floor and slowly , the world of camel racing begins to open up to us
the conversation is all about camels ; the best breeds , famous old champions , training methods , bad losers and potential winners
over arabic coffee and dates i am told that remote controlled robots have replaced children as camel jockeys -- this primal sport is moving with the times
once lunch is over , we head to the track for the racing to begin
there will be 14 races through the afternoon
and in addition to the honor and prestige , the camels are racing for thousands of dollars in prize money and fancy new cars for their owners
it 's surprising how spectacular camel racing can be
compared to the grace of thoroughbred racehorses , camels are indeed ungainly creatures
but 20 of these huge beasts pounding around a track in the desert is really a sight to behold , their hooves throwing up a cloud of dust in their wake
their owners hang out of their four - by - fours , shouting encouragement while trying to keep up with their charges
the winning camels are paraded with pride , their heads and necks covered in bright golden saffron and their owners applauded for their efforts and rewarded with cash prizes
as we excitedly watch the final race draw to a close , the sun sets across the sky of this metropolis
camel racing bears no relevance to the modernity embraced here , but this old - fashioned sport is equally as fascinating .

camel racing is a centuries - old tradition in the gulf
modern technology is changing the sport
camels compete for thousands of dollars in prize money
