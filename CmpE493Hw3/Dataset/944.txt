the world 's seventh - largest economy is heading toward collapse
an economic powerhouse conservatively valued at $ 24 trillion , one that annually churns out the equivalent of $ 2.5 trillion , is under assault
however , i am not referring to one of the g8 economies , but to the " super economy " of the ocean
it 's one that for far too long has been ignored and taken for granted -- and it is going downhill fast
the health and wealth of the ocean are assessed in a wwf report released thursday , reviving the ocean economy
the report is the result of a hard economic analysis performed by the boston consulting group built on a foundation of the latest ocean science provided by the global change institute of the university of queensland
true , the enormity of the ocean can complicate any single appraisal
but it is still important to try to understand its value if global leaders are ever going to sustain it for future generations
the fact is that the ocean feeds us , employs us , offers protection and plays a direct role in the lives and livelihoods of people throughout the world
the ocean also provides intangible but essential services to humanity , such as climate regulation and oxygen production , that are difficult to put in monetary terms
and while we all may look at the ocean from different perspectives , no one can escape the fact that it is a shared resource that provides for each and every one of us
a figure that may get lost in the headlines generated by our report is perhaps most telling : seventy percent of the ocean 's overall economic value relies on its continued health
ocean assets like fisheries , coral reefs , mangroves and seagrasses that produce goods and services rivaling the world 's top 10 economies will lose their value if we continue to over-exploit and outright destroy them
that may seem like a far - off possibility to some , but it is a future foretold by the many details in this report
for example , 90 percent of the world 's fish stocks are either fully exploited or over-exploited
and that is not all
by 2050 -- only a few decades from now -- it is possible that the ocean could lose its coral reefs , which have already been halved in the last few decades
this is n't just a concern for dive enthusiasts , but to the hundreds of millions of people that rely on ocean resources for their daily meals and their weekly paychecks
the ocean is truly too big to fail
the loss of the ocean 's critical habitats and species would have a devastating ripple effect on global food security and economies that no government bailout could salvage
fortunately , our report identifies actions that would revive the ocean economy , three of which are critical this year
first , the international community must rally around a set of sustainable development goals that clearly reflect the link between the environment -- including the ocean -- and human well - being
also , negotiators meeting in paris later this year must agree on an ambitious global climate deal that sets us on the path to avert the worst impacts of climate change
and finally , leaders must commit to conserving increasing amounts of coastal and marine areas over the course of the next 15 years
the economic case for why the ocean is so critical to livelihoods around the world is clear , and we will not be able to plead ignorance if we collectively preside over the collapse of the ocean economy
reviving the ocean economy is dedicated to helping us avoid that outcome , but it will require political vision and courage among policymakers
all this said , and as terrifying as it is that the deterioration of the ocean 's health has been its fastest in millions of years , there is actually some ( potential ) good news : if we act swiftly and with determination , marine resources can recover -- and recover quickly
many local examples -- from the mediterranean to the mozambique channel , from the fiji archipelago to the arctic -- show us that conservation , restoration and sustainable - use approaches mean the ocean , and the people who depend on it , can both prosper
ultimately , the ocean bridges continents , connects cultures and offers equal opportunity inspiration and we should therefore work together in support of this vital shared resource
but if we are to have any chance of avoiding the point of no return , we must find ways of reaching genuine global commitments on sustainable development and climate
after all , it 's far better to avoid an economic collapse than be forced to scramble to pick up the pieces .
