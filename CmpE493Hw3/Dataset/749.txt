polk city , florida if you drove by it , you would n't even know it 's there
the ringling bros. center for elephant conservation sits on 200 acres of land in rural central florida , halfway between orlando and sarasota , off a nondescript country road
an armed security guard greets you at the entrance
after a short drive down a gravel road , you get the sense this is a special place
" you can walk around and you do n't hear anything , " said kenneth feld , who opened the center in 1995
" these elephants , they have these large feet and they travel silently through the fields
i think it 's very peaceful
" twenty - nine elephants currently live here , and 13 more will join the group by 2018 , after ringling bros. decided this year to stop using elephants in its traveling circus
" this was a decision that our family had discussed for quite some time , " said feld , chairman and ceo of feld entertainment , the company that owns ringling bros. and barnum & bailey
the change comes after years of repeated criticism and lawsuits by animal rights groups
the ultimate decision to phase out the elephants , feld said , is the result of the different laws regulating the use of the animals in each of the 115 cities the circus visits every year
" you ca n't operate any business , much less with animals , if you do n't have consistency from city to city , " feld said
" it 's a definite expense to be in litigation and to be fighting legislation , and there is a saying and it 's been around for a long time : ' you ca n't fight city hall
' and we found that to be the case in this situation
" the circus business has been a part of the feld family since 1967 , when irvin feld purchased ringling bros. and barnum & bailey
when irvin died in 1984 , his son , kenneth , took over
" this is a whole family affair , " he said
" it 's a family affair for our family but also for all the elephants
" when the center opened 20 years ago , it housed fewer than 10 elephants
" it was a place for elephants to retire , " feld said
today , the center houses elephants of all ages
" we have lots of different elephants , meaning males and females , youth elephants , older elephants , so it is a great place to study behavior , " he said
the center is also focused on breeding the animals
wendy kiso , a research and conservation scientist , spends her days at an onsite lab , trying to figure out how to keep the species from going extinct
part of her lab includes several tanks that " cryo - preserve " elephant sperm at negative - 196 degrees
" we process the semen and we extend it in such a way that we can freeze it , " kiso said
" this is a genetic resource bank for asian elephants
" twenty - six elephants have been born here , feld said
mike , the newest pachyderm to join the group , was born at the center 's birthing barn nearly two years ago
" we have the largest and only sustainable herd of asian elephants in the western hemisphere , " feld said
caring for the elephants is no small task
trudy williams and her husband , jim , spend their time taking care of the animals ' daily needs
it takes the couple hours to bathe , walk and feed the elephants every day
" first thing in the morning , we water them , and give them some treats and feed them some hay , " williams said
each elephant eats about 150 pounds of food a day
twenty - one tons of hay usually lasts only 10 days at the center
exercise is also part of the daily routine , including stretching
" we just do that a few times on each leg with them , just to give them a good stretch , " williams said
" we do some footwork with them
all of our elephants , generally once a month , get a pedicure , just to make sure their feet are in good condition
" all of this care is n't cheap
" each elephant costs over $ 65,000 a year , per year , over all the years of their life , " feld said
" we 're fortunate we 're for profit
we do make a profit and we 're a privately owned family business , and so we 've made a decision we want to devote a lot of resources here
" it 's a price feld said he 's willing to pay to keep this species -- some varieties of which in asia and africa are endangered -- alive for generations to come
" i always say , it 's sort of like jurassic park with a happy ending , " feld said
" we knew that if we did n't do something , maybe my grandchildren would never have the opportunity to see these incredible animals
" cnn 's javier de diego contributed to this report .

29 elephants currently live at the circus sanctuary , and 13 more will join by 2018
the expansion comes after ringling bros. said it would stop using elephants in circus
$ 65,000 worth of care annually includes pedicures , stretching and tons -- literally -- of food
