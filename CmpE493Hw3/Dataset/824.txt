a longtime friend of joni mitchell has filed a legal petition seeking to be named the singer - songwriter 's conservator
mitchell , who was inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame in 1997 , was taken to ucla medical center a month ago after being found unconscious in her home
she remains at the hospital , according to leslie morris ' court petition filed april 28
morris is described as mitchell 's friend of more than 44 years in the legal documents
whether the folk and jazz singer is conscious remains a matter of some confusion
in her april 28 petition , morris says mitchell is unconscious : " at this time she ( mitchell ) remains unconscious and unable to make any responses , and is therefore unable to provide for any of her personal needs
" but on mitchell 's website , a statement posted the same day that says it was approved by morris says mitchell is alert
" contrary to rumors circulating on the internet today , joni is not in a coma
joni is still in the hospital -- but she comprehends , she 's alert , and she has her full senses
a full recovery is expected
the document obtained by a certain media outlet simply gives her longtime friend leslie morris the authority -- in the absence of 24 - hour doctor care -- to make care decisions for joni once she leaves the hospital
" when asked about the discrepancy between statements about mitchell 's health on her website and in the legal filing , her publicist , alisse kingsley , responded that " the website " was accurate
a doctor 's capacity declaration stated that mitchell will likely be unable , due to her medical condition , to attend any court hearings for the next four to six months
adoring fans are posting their tributes to mitchell at weloveyoujoni.com
