baghdad , iraq izzat ibrahim al - douri , a former top deputy to saddam hussein and more recently a key figure in sunni extremist groups battling the iraqi government , has been killed in a security operation in that country , iraqi state - run television reported friday
al - douri was the highest - ranking member of hussein 's regime to evade capture -- the " king of clubs " in a deck of playing cards used by american troops to identify the most - wanted regime officials
he also was a man thought to have led the post-hussein sunni extremist group naqshbandi army
military analysis website globalsecurity.org says the naqshbandi army supports isis , which has taken over parts of iraq and syria
al - douri was killed in an operation by iraqi security forces and shia militia members in the hamrin mountains between tikrit and kirkuk , iraq , shia militia commander hadi al - ameri said
that militia is a predominantly shiite fighting group that worked with iraqi troops earlier this month to liberate the iraqi city of tikrit from isis
the death of al - douri was also reported by the governor of salahuddin province , raid al - jubouri , who spoke by phone on iraqi television
al - douri 's body arrived friday in baghdad , where dna samples were taken to confirm the identity , said the spokesman of another shiite militia called hashd shaabi in an interview with state - run iraqiya tv
dna test results could be available in 48 hours , hashd shaabi spokesman yousuf al - kilabi told the outlet
the u.s. military is aware of the media reports but does n't have further information to evaluate them , said col. patrick ryder , spokesman for u.s. central command
while officials are aware of al - douri 's role in the hussein regime , ryder declined to comment about whether the united states or the coalition was targeting any specific individuals
al - douri was a military commander and vice chairman of the country 's revolutionary command council in hussein 's sunni - dominated regime -- effectively hussein 's no. 2 man
hussein 's regime fell during a u.s. - led invasion in 2003
the u.s. military had said that after the iraqi leader 's fall , al - douri helped finance a sunni insurgency with money he transferred to syria before the government collapsed
a month before the invasion , al - douri presided over a military parade in mosul , an event covered by cnn , and his participation became one of the last times he was seen in public , covered by cnn
al - douri saluted troops from the reviewing stand as they marched by
then , just days before the u.s. invasion , al - douri addressed an emergency summit of the organization of the islamic conference to discuss ultimately unsuccessful ways to avert the war
al - douri accused the united states of aggression and blamed kuwait for his country 's suffering , calling leaders of the neighboring gulf state " traitors " for cooperating with the united states and israel
that comment prompted the kuwaiti representative to stand up and protest , to which al - douri countered , " shut up , sit down you small agent [ of the u.s. ] , you monkey ! " kuwaiti television cut away from the heated exchange and rejoined the conference later
al - douri 's efforts were all in vain
the united states invaded iraq on march 19 , 2003 , ousting hussein , al - douri and the entire regime
in subsequent years , several claims asserted that al - douri was either killed or captured during the war and its aftermath
at the same time , a man claiming to be al - douri released a number of audio messages over the years taunting iraqi and u.s. officials
in 2012 , a series of videos appeared online purporting to show al - douri deriding the shiite - led government that took over iraq after hussein 's ouster
cnn could n't independently verify the authenticity of those videos on youtube or the identity of the man speaking , though he bore a striking resemblance to al - douri
in the clips , the man who claimed to be al - douri wore an olive military uniform and sat behind a desk with an iraqi flag in the background
he derided iraq 's shiite - dominated government , led by then - prime minister nuri al - maliki , as well as what he described as meddling by neighboring iran
al - maliki 's dawa party , says al - douri , " has announced iraq as the shiite capital
" at that time , nine years had passed since the invasion and , al - douri claimed that iraq was still in peril
" everyone can hear the sounds of danger echoing daily and threatening the country , " he said
the videos were posted on what was the 65th anniversary of the arab socialist baath party , a political party founded in syria that later provided the political basis for hussein 's now outlawed baath party
