hln 's # meforreal is an uplifting , revealing conversation about the way we present ourselves online
we want to see the real parts of life , the ones that do n't get a filter or a facebook post but are a part of our realities nonetheless
tag your favorite unscripted , unedited , un-perfected moments using # meforreal and see what others are sharing on facebook , twitter and the daily share
the internet is always quick to dish out judgmental opinions , such as the body - hate people showed to singer p ! nk after she posted a photo of herself in a black dress she wore to a cancer benefit this past weekend ( which , if you ask us , was pretty fantastic , and she looked fabulous in it
) as a woman with a lot of experience singing to her detractors , though , she knew exactly what to say and how to say it
and when it came to keeping her tongue firmly in cheek while she schooled people who had nothing better to do than be totally rude , she owned it
clearly , it 's not troubling p ! nk or her hubs , carey hart ( who , by the way , is quite handsome himself , so clearly he has rad taste )
not only did p ! nk 's response rally her fans , but they also started sharing their own photos of themselves post-pregnancy and embracing what p ! nk tells her daughter is her " squishiness
" postscript for the haters : we think you just racked up more fans for p ! nk
now go look in a mirror , and tell us -- are you perfect ?

p ! nk took to twitter to address online comments about her body
her " squishiness " is a result of happiness , she says
