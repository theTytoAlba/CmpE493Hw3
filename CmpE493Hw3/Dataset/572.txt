garissa , kenya days after a horrific al - shabaab attack on its soil , kenya launched airstrikes targeting the terror group in somalia , according to a military source , who insisted the strikes were not retribution for last week 's massacre at garissa university college that killed nearly 150 people
" the latest attack of al - shabaab bases by the kenya military is part of the ongoing operations that started in 2011
it is not a retaliation to the garissa attack
the operation has been ongoing , " the military source said monday
it is customary for kenyan military sources not to give their names to media
two of the airstrikes hit al - shabaab training camps , according to a resident of the southwest somalian town of bardera , almost 200 kilometers ( 125 miles ) from the kenyan border , and a local journalist who asked not to be named out of fear for his safety
the kenyan military began its bombing raids sunday afternoon , targeting the al - shabaab stronghold of godon dhawe , somali resident ibrahim mohammed said
godon dhawe is between bardera and the somalia - kenya border
al - shabaab , an al qaeda - linked militant group based in somalia , has claimed responsibility for the university attack
also monday , a police source said kenyan authorities had intelligence beforehand that a university in garissa could be attacked , yet the country 's rapid response team was stuck in nairobi for hours after the massacre began , arranging for transport
it 's not clear exactly why the elite team was stuck in the kenyan capital , roughly 370 kilometers ( 230 miles ) west of the attack , but the police source in garissa told cnn that kenyan politicians and nairobi - based journalists arrived on the scene before the team did
journalists on the ground corroborated that report
once the team entered the university complex , the situation was quickly defused , journalists and the police source said
manoah esipisu , a spokesman for kenya 's president and deputy president , defended the response time , telling cnn there is always criticism regarding whether " you reacted as fast as you have or should n't have
" " with the benefit of hindsight you can always say things could have been done better , " he said , adding that kenyan authorities saved a lot of students and " got the job done
" foreign minister amina mohamed echoed those remarks in a monday interview with cnn , saying the response was sufficient and denying reports that it was the elite rapid response team alone that brought an end to the situation
" we have a military garrison in garissa , and the work began immediately after the attack was reported and continued for a number of hours until we were able to rescue 663 students of the 800 students that had been taken hostage by these terrorists
so the response was adequate , " she said
she repeated esipisu 's assertion that dubbing the response slow is a reaction that comes only with the luxury of hindsight
" obviously when parents are grieving and the country is mourning , it 's always easy to fall back on things like that , but i can assure you that we took very quick action as soon as this was reported , " mohamed said
" obviously hindsight is always 20/20
we did everything that we could do
" the kenyan government says mohamed mohamud is the mastermind of thursday 's terrorist attack on garissa university college
the country 's interior ministry singled out mohamud , a senior leader of al - shabaab , on twitter
he is also known by the aliases dulyadin and gamadhere , it said
mohamud is " credited with having an extensive terrorist network within kenya , " according to a kenyan ministry document given to cnn
the ministry posted a " most wanted " notice for mohamud
it offers a reward of 20 million kenyan shillings , about $ 215,000
" we appeal to anyone with any info on # gamadhere to share with relevant authorities and security agencies , " the interior ministry posted on twitter
mohamud is in charge of external operations against kenya , the document says , and he is the regional commander within al - shabaab in charge of the juba region
in this role , he commands the militia along the border and " is responsible for cross-border incursions in the country
" his position as one of al - shabaab 's top field commanders in southern somalia has brought him into direct conflict with kenyan troops deployed as part of african union forces in the country
" this is a man who has a lot of grudges against the kenyans , " said stig jarle hansen , an associate professor at oslo 's norwegian university of life sciences and author of " al - shabaab in somalia : the history and ideology of a militant islamist group
" mohamud 's network extends within the dadaab refugee camp , the document says
dadaab is the world 's biggest refugee camp , home to thousands of people , according to the united nations
it 's in kenya 's north eastern province near somalia
garissa , the town where the university attack took place , is about 150 kilometers ( 90 miles ) from the somali border
it 's within " striking distance " of mohamud 's stronghold in somalia 's middle juba province , hansen told cnn
but he noted that mohamud is better known " for tactical military attacks rather than terrorist attacks
" inside garissa university college dorm 's scene of slaughter over the weekend , al - shabaab promised to bring about " another bloodbath " in kenya
though the terrorist group is based in somalia , it has n't confined its violence to the lawless nation
in 2013 , militants attacked nairobi 's upscale westgate mall
mohamud has claimed responsibility for several attacks in the past few years , including december 's attack on a quarry in a kenyan village near the somali border , which killed at least 36 people
in that attack , al - shabaab militants separated non-muslim workers from their muslim counterparts and killed them
mohamud is kenyan and has three wives and three siblings , including two with links to al - shabaab , the document says
he 's from a clan , the ogaden , that has a heavy presence in kenya and somalia , hansen said
" the borders historically have been meaningless to them , " he said
cnn exclusive : exposing smuggler routes across the somalia - kenya border on sunday , kenya 's interior ministry identified another terrorist involved in the garissa university college attack as abdirahim abdullahi
abdullahi 's father , abdullahi daqare , a government chief in mandera in northern kenya , told cnn that his son was missing
daqare is a kenyan somali , he said
his son graduated in 2013 from nairobi university law school and worked for a bank for two months before he went missing , daqare said in a phone interview
" i have received reports from people who found information ( on ) the internet that my son was one of the terrorists , " daqare said
" i previously told the government that the son is missing
i sought their help to find the whereabouts of my son
" he added that the two had not been in contact since his son disappeared
daqare said he had " really given up on him
" on sunday , families of some of the more than 147 people slain at garissa university college left a mortuary in nairobi after identifying the bodies of their loved ones
one woman almost had to be carried out
" why ? why ? where are you , my children ? " she wailed
across garissa , there was a sense of fear , foreboding and grief
the news agency reuters videotaped a man holding his daughter 's hand at a church as military patrols and security officials searched people
a church member told the agency , " nowhere is safe , but here in church you can come , you be with god and then you just console yourself
" three days of national mourning for victims of the attack , declared by kenyan president uhuru kenyatta , began sunday
