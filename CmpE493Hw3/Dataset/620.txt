ahmed farouq did n't have the prestige of fellow al qaeda figure osama bin laden , the influence of anwar al - awlaki , or the notoriety of adam gadahn
still , he was a big deal
that 's the assessment of multiple sources on a man who may not have been well - known in the west , but nonetheless had a special role in the terrorist group
farouq -- an american -- died in a u.s. counterterrorism airstrike in january , according to the white house
two al qaeda hostages , warren weinstein of the united states and giovanni lo porto from italy , were killed in the same strike , while gadahn died in another u.s. operation that month
before that , farouq was the deputy emir of al qaeda in the indian subcontinent , or aqis , a branch of the islamist extremist group that formed in recent years
the branch made its presence known in september 2014 , when militants infiltrated pakistan 's navy and tried to hijack one of its ships , according to the site institute , which monitors terror groups
the group 's spokesman , usama mahmoud , on twitter compared the pakistani naval officers involved in the attempted hijacking to nidal hasan , site reported
hasan is the u.s. army psychiatrist sentenced to death for killing 13 people at fort hood , texas
osama mehmood , a spokesman for al qaeda in the indian subcontinent , said that farouq and another top figure , qari abdullah mansur , were killed in a january 15 drone strike in pakistan 's shawal valley
they were senior al qaeda leaders , according to mehmood
american mouthpiece for al qaeda killed cnn 's sophia saifi contributed to this report .
