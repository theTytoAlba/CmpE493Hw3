think it 's hard to redeem your miles for an airline award ticket ? it depends on which airline rewards program you 've chosen , which route you 're flying and when you book your ticket , according to a new consumer reports study of 70 million passenger trips over the past two years
the magazine collected statistics comparing award - seat availability for the five biggest u.s. airlines on domestic routes
the top performer was southwest airlines , which offered the most award tickets , 11.9 million , and the highest percentage of award tickets -- 11.5 % of 103.1 million total passenger seats
" the high number of award tickets is directly related to southwest 's unique combination of ' every seat is an award seat , ' no blackout dates , points that do n't expire , and a route map that reaches more than 90 different destinations in the u.s. and beyond , making us the largest domestic carrier in the u.s. , " southwest spokesperson thais conway hanson told cnn
" unlike other carriers , we also do n't charge fees for close - in bookings or penalize you for canceling your trip if something else comes up
" at the bottom of the list was jetblue , which offered the lowest percentage of award seats and the fewest number of award tickets of the five biggest u.s. airlines : 892,000 one - way passenger tickets , or 4.5 % of its total 19.7 million u.s. seats
( jetblue only operates in 10 of the top 25 markets included in the study
) many jetblue customers fly the airline only once or twice per year , making it hard to accumulate miles , an airline spokesman told the magazine
by not allowing miles to expire anymore , the airline says customers will be able to eventually redeem them
delta air lines came in second place with 5.6 million u.s. award seats ; united airlines ranked third with 5 million u.s. award tickets ; and american airlines was fourth with 3.5 million u.s. award seats
what are the world 's safest airlines ? remember that award tickets are n't actually free
the cost of miles is built into everything you buy that 's earning you miles , and the airlines profit from you not using your miles at all
so it behooves consumers to book award travel carefully
on average , nearly 10 % of passengers on the five airlines analyzed by consumer reports flew on domestic award tickets , but some of them were n't getting the best value for their miles
while many u.s. fliers redeemed miles on american airlines flights from los angeles to san francisco , the cheapest average fare on that route was just over $ 100 -- not worth the 12,500 to 30,000 miles needed for an award ticket , consumer reports says
better to use them on american airlines ' route between new york and san francisco or delta 's route between chicago and los angeles , which are generally more expensive than that los angeles - san francisco route , according to consumer reports ' calculations
while award - seat availability is important , it may not matter as much as passengers ' overall satisfaction with an airline
southwest had the highest customer satisfaction score ( 86 ) , followed by jetblue ( 85 ) , delta ( 70 ) , american ( 66 ) and united ( 63 )
and do n't forget the fees
southwest does n't charge any fees , while other airlines tack on fees for checking bags , booking by phone , changing plans and more .

southwest airlines tops consumer reports ' survey , with the most seats available
jetblue is at the bottom of the list but ranks high in customer satisfaction
